To understand the\\nrobustness of risk prediction models for heart failure (HF), we conducted a\\nsystematic literature review to (1) identify HF risk-prediction models, (2)\\nassess statistical approach and extent of validation, (3) identify common\\nvariables, and (4) assess risk of bias (ROB).\\nMETHODS: Literature databases were searched from March 2013 to May 2018 to\\nidentify risk prediction models conducted in an out-of-hospital setting in adults\\nwith HF. Distinct risk prediction variables were ranked according to outcomes\\nassessed and incorporation into the studies. ROB was assessed using Prediction\\nmodel Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST).\\nRESULTS: Of 4720 non-duplicated citations, 40 risk-prediction publications were\\ndeemed relevant. Within the 40 publications, 58 models assessed 55 (co)primary\\noutcomes, including all-cause mortality (n = 17), cardiovascular death (n = 9),\\nHF hospitalizations (n = 15), and composite endpoints (n = 14). Few publications \\nreported detail on handling missing data (n = 11; 28%). The discriminatory\\nability for predicting all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and composite\\nendpoints was generally better than for HF hospitalization. 105 distinct\\npredictor variables were identified. Predictors included in >5 publications were:\\nN-terminal prohormone brain-natriuretic peptide, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,\\nsystolic blood pressure, sodium, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction, \\nheart rate, and characteristics including male sex, diabetes, age, and BMI. Only \\n11/58 (19%) models had overall low ROB, based on our application of PROBAST. In\\ntotal, 26/58 (45%) models discussed internal validation, and 14/58 (24%) external\\nvalidation.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The majority of the 58 identified risk-prediction models for HF\\npresent particular concerns according to ROB assessment, mainly due to lack of\\nvalidation and calibration. The potential utility of novel approaches such as\\nmachine learning tools is yet to be determined.\\nREGISTRATION NUMBER: The SLR was registered in Prospero (ID: CRD42018100709).\",\n",

Segmentation of ventricular cavities and\\nmyocardium in cardiac cine sequencing provides a basis to quantify cardiac\\nmeasures such as ejection fraction. A method is presented that curtails the\\nexpense and observer bias of manual cardiac evaluation by combining semantic\\nsegmentation and disease classification into a fully automatic processing\\npipeline. The initial processing element consists of a robust dilated\\nconvolutional neural network architecture for voxel-wise segmentation of the\\nmyocardium and ventricular cavities. The resulting comprehensive volumetric\\nfeature matrix captures diagnostic clinical procedure data and is utilized by the\\nfinal processing element to model a cardiac pathology classifier. Our approach\\nevaluated anonymized cardiac images from a training data set of 100 patients (4\\npathology groups, 1 healthy group, 20 patients per group) examined at the\\nUniversity Hospital of Dijon. The top average Dice index scores achieved were\\n0.940, 0.886, and 0.849 for structure segmentation of the left ventricle (LV),\\nmyocardium, and right ventricle (RV), respectively. A 5-ary pathology\\nclassification accuracy of 90% was recorded on an independent test set using the \\ntrained model.

Additional advances in other alternative FFR approaches, including\\nnon-invasive coronary CT (FFRCT), invasive angiography (FFRangio), and optical\\ncoherence tomography (FFROCT), are being realized. Artificial intelligence\\nalgorithms and robust tools that enable detailed pre-procedure \"virtual\"\\nintervention are also emerging. The benefits of coronary physiological assessment\\nto determine lesion functional significance are well established. In addition to \\nstable CAD, coronary physiology can be especially helpful in clinical scenarios\\nsuch as left main and multivessel CAD, serial lesions, non-infarct-related\\narteries in acute coronary syndromes, and residual ischemia post-PCI.

A gap in the current literature exists\\nregarding the relationship between the neurotropic nature of WNV in vertebrates, \\nvirus propagation and transmission in nature.

One particular challenge is the\\nanalysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell\\npopulations and track how they change across time points. To facilitate this\\nanalysis, we developed FLOW-MAP, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based software \\ntool that uses graph layout analysis with sequential time ordering to visualize\\ncellular trajectories in high-dimensional single-cell datasets obtained from flow\\ncytometry, mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments.\\nHere we provide a detailed description of the FLOW-MAP algorithm and how to use\\nthe open-source R package FLOWMAPR via its GUI or with text-based commands. This \\napproach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell\\ndifferentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug\\nresistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a\\nstep-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from\\nmouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, \\nmesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a\\npreviously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental\\ndatasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other\\nsingle-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the\\nFLOW-MAP approach.

An additional target\\nenrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification \\nin low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be\\nlimited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or\\ncross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer\\nenrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while\\nsimultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We\\nevaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment\\nand mean 47% (±16%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone.\\nVirus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was\\ncomparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the\\ndetection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma \\nsamples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or\\nco-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including\\nPowassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE.

       "       'DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in central airway epithelial cells (AECs) may\\nplay a key role in pathological processes in asthma. The goal of the current\\nstudy is to compare the diagnostic performance of DNAm markers across three\\ntissues: AECs, nasal epithelial cells (NECs), and peripheral blood mononuclear\\ncells (PBMCs). Additionally, we focused on the results using the machine learning\\nalgorithm in the context of multi-locus effects to evaluate the diagnostic\\nperformance of the optimal subset of CpG sites. We obtained 74 subjects with\\nasthma and 41 controls from AECs, 15 subjects with asthma and 14 controls from\\nNECs, 697 subjects with asthma and 97 controls from PBMCs. Epigenome-wide DNA\\nmethylation levels in AECs, NECs and PBMCs were measured using the Infinium Human\\nMethylation 450\\u2009K BeadChip. Overlap analysis across the three different sample\\nsources at the locus and pathway levels were studied to investigate shared or\\nunique pathophysiological processes of asthma across tissues. Using the top 100\\nasthma-associated methylation markers as classifiers from each dataset, we found \\nthat both AEC- and NEC-based DNAm signatures exerted a lower classification error\\nthan the PBMC-based DNAm markers (p-value\\u2009=\\u20090.0002). The area-under-the-curve\\n(AUC) analysis based on out-of-bag errors using the random forest classification \\nalgorithm revealed that PBMC-, NEC-, and AEC-based methylation data yielded 31\\nloci (AUC: 0.87), 8 loci (AUC: 0.99), and 4 loci (AUC: 0.97) from each optimal\\nsubset of tissue-specific markers, respectively. We also discovered the\\nlocus-locus interaction of DNAm levels of the CDH6 gene and RAPGEF3 gene might\\ninteract with each other to jointly predict the risk of asthma - which suggests\\nthe pivotal role of cell-cell junction in the pathological changes of asthma.\\nBoth AECs and NECs might provide better diagnostic accuracy and efficacy levels\\nthan PBMCs.

However, radiation-induced cardiac toxicity\\namong patients with early-stage NSCLC who have undergone stereotactic ablative\\nradiotherapy (SABR) has been less well-characterized. Our objective was to assess\\nthe associations between cardiac radiation dosimetry and OS in patients with\\nearly-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, 153 patients with early-stage NSCLC had\\nundergone SABR at a single institution. The maximum dose, mean dose, V10Gy,\\nV25Gy, and V50Gy to 15 cardiac substructures and the whole heart were analyzed\\nfor their association with OS using the Kaplan-Meier method. An artificial neural\\nnetwork (ANN) analysis was performed to modulate confounding behaviors of\\ndosimetric variables to predict for OS.\\nRESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included in the present analysis. The right\\nventricle (RV) V10Gy most negatively predicted for OS, such that patients who had\\nreceived a RV V10Gy dose\\xa0< 4% had significantly longer OS than patients who had\\nreceived a RV V10Gy does > 4% (5.3 years vs. 2.4 years). On ANN analysis, 74\\ninput features, including cardiac dosimetry parameters, predicted for survival\\nwith a test accuracy of 64.7%. A repeat ANN analysis using dosimetry to dose\\nneutral structure confirmed the predictive power of cardiac dosimetry.\\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac dosimetry to subvolumes of the heart was associated with\\ndecreased OS in patients with early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR. These data\\nsupport the importance of minimizing the radiation dose to cardiac substructures.\\nFurther prioritizing the heart as an organ at risk might be warranted.\\nAdditionally, cardiac follow-up should be considered.\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Following\\nvalidation using a canonical AHR ligand (a dioxin derivative), the transgenic\\nmice were subjected to adenine-induced and ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury\\nmodels representing CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI), respectively, in humans.\\nIndoxyl sulfate was artificially increased in mice through the drinking water and\\nby inhibiting its excretion into the urine. Adenine-fed mice showed a distinct\\nand significant increase in β-galactosidase in the proximal and distal renal\\ntubules, cardiac myocytes, hepatocytes, and microvasculature in the cerebral\\ncortex. The pattern of β-galactosidase increase coincided with the changes in\\nserum indoxyl sulfate levels. Machine-learning-based image quantification\\nrevealed positive correlations between indoxyl sulfate levels and β-galactosidase\\nexpression in various tissues.

The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of\\nnormal, HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction\\nautomatically.\\nMETHODS: We proposed a novel HF screening framework based on gated recurrent unit\\n(GRU) model in this study. The logistic regression-based hidden semi-Markov model\\nwas adopted to segment HS frames.

Indeed, beyond\\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ASCVD risk is also dependent on a\\ncluster of metabolic abnormalities characterized by elevated fasting and\\npost-prandial levels of TG-rich lipoproteins and their remnants. In a\\nhead-to-head comparison between murine models for ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, the former\\nwas found to be a better pharmacological target for the treatment of\\nhypertriglyceridemia. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 are\\nassociated with a marked reduction of plasma levels of VLDL, low-density\\nlipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Carriers of\\nloss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL4 show instead lower TG-rich lipoproteins and\\na modest but significant increase of HDL.

To aid identification of the\\nmost effective interventions it is crucial to understand whether there are sex\\ndifferences in dietary behaviours related to CVD risk.\\nMETHODS: From a dataset of 46 nationally representative surveys, we included data\\nfrom seven countries that had recorded the same dietary behaviour measurements in\\nadults; Bhutan, Eswatini, Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Nepal and St Vincent and the\\nGrenadines (2013-2017). Three dietary behaviours were investigated: positive salt\\nuse behaviour (SUB), meeting fruit and vegetable (F&V) recommendations and use of\\nvegetable oil rather than animal fats in cooking. Generalized linear models were \\nused to investigate the association between dietary behaviours and waist\\ncircumference (WC) and undiagnosed and diagnosed hypertension and diabetes.\\nInteraction terms between sex and dietary behaviour were added to test for sex\\ndifferences.\\nRESULTS: Twenty-four thousand three hundred thirty-two participants were\\nincluded.

       "       'This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false\\nalarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using \\nsingle- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature\\nare either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis\\nto build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on\\nhand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to\\nautomatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more\\nemphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more \\nlikely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the\\ntemporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method\\nefficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and\\nfine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet\\ncomputing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that\\nthe proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms \\nfor the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a\\nsensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification,\\nconsidering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate \\nalarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG\\n(e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for\\nalarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia).',\n",
       "       'BACKGROUND: Blood glucose control is closely related to type 2 diabetes mellitus \\n(T2DM) prognosis. This multicenter study aimed to investigate blood glucose\\ncontrol among patients with insulin-treated T2DM in North China and explore the\\napplication value of combining an elastic network (EN) with a machine-learning\\nalgorithm to predict glycemic control.\\nMETHODS: Basic information, biochemical indices, and diabetes-related data were\\ncollected via questionnaire from 2787 consecutive participants recruited from 27 \\ncenters in six cities between January 2016 and December 2017. An EN regression\\nwas used to address variable collinearity. Then, three common machine learning\\nalgorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and back\\npropagation artificial neural network [BP-ANN]) were used to simulate and predict\\nblood glucose status. Additionally, a stepwise logistic regression was performed \\nto compare the machine learning models.\\nRESULTS: The well-controlled blood glucose rate was 45.82% in North China. The\\nmultivariable analysis found that hypertension history, atherosclerotic\\ncardiovascular disease history, exercise, and total cholesterol were protective\\nfactors in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control, while central adiposity,\\nfamily history, T2DM duration, complications, insulin dose, blood pressure, and\\nhypertension were risk factors for elevated HbA1c. Before the dimensional\\nreduction in the EN, the areas under the curve of RF, SVM, and BP were 0.73,\\n0.61, and 0.70, respectively, while these figures increased to 0.75, 0.72, and\\n0.72, respectively, after dimensional reduction. Moreover, the EN and machine\\nlearning models had higher sensitivity and accuracy than the logistic regression \\nmodels (the sensitivity and accuracy of logistic were 0.52 and 0.56; RF: 0.79,\\n0.70; SVM: 0.84, 0.73; BP-ANN: 0.78, 0.73, respectively).\\nCONCLUSIONS: More than half of T2DM patients in North China had poor glycemic\\ncontrol and were at a higher risk of developing diabetic complications. The EN\\nand machine learning algorithms are alternative choices, in addition to the\\ntraditional logistic model, for building predictive models of blood glucose\\ncontrol in patients with T2DM.',\n",

The IGF1/Igf1 gene encodes\\nmultiple protein isoforms that differ in tissue expression, potency, and\\nfunction, particularly in cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as \\nin systemic versus localized signaling. Genome engineering is a novel strategy\\nfor increasing gene expression and has the potential to recapitulate the diverse \\nbiology seen in IGF1 signaling through the overexpression of multiple IGF1\\nisoforms.

       "       'BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein-AI (apo-AI) is the major apolipoprotein found in high \\ndensity lipoprotein particles (HDLs). We previously demonstrated that apo-AI\\ninjected directly into high-fat diet fed mice improved insulin sensitivity\\nassociated with decreased hepatic inflammation. While our data provides\\ncompelling proof of concept, apoA-I mimetic peptides are more clinically\\nfeasible. The aim of this study was to test whether apo-AI mimetic peptide (D-4F \\nand L-5F) treatment will emulate the effects of full-length apo-AI to improve\\ninsulin sensitivity.\\nMETHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks before receiving\\nD4F mimetic peptide administered via drinking water or L5F mimetic peptide\\nadministered by intraperitoneal injection bi-weekly for a total of five weeks.\\nGlucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were conducted to assess the\\neffects of the peptides on insulin resistance. Effects of the peptides on\\ninflammation, gluconeogenic enzymes and lipid synthesis were assessed by\\nreal-time PCR of key markers involved in the respective pathways.\\nRESULTS: Treatment with apo-AI mimetic peptides D-4F and L-5F showed: (i)\\nimproved blood glucose clearance (D-4F 1.40-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD,\\nP<0.05; L-4F 1.17-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, ns) in the glucose tolerance\\ntest; (ii) improved insulin tolerance (D-4F 1.63-fold AUC decrease compared to\\nHFD, P<0.05; L-5F 1.39-fold AUC compared to HFD, P<0.05) in the insulin tolerance\\ntest. The metabolic test results were associated with (i) decreased hepatic\\ninflammation of SAA1, IL-1β IFN-γ and TNFα (2.61-5.97-fold decrease compared to\\nHFD, P<0.05) for both mimetics; (ii) suppression of hepatic mRNA expression of\\ngluconeogenesis-associated genes (PEPCK and G6Pase; 1.66-3.01-fold decrease\\ncompared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics; (iii) lipogenic-associated genes,\\n(SREBP1c and ChREBP; 2.15-3.31-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both\\nmimetics and; (iv) reduced hepatic macrophage infiltration (F4/80 and CD68;\\n1.77-2.15-fold compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics.\\nCONCLUSION: Apo-AI mimetic peptides treatment led to improved glucose\\nhomeostasis. This effect is associated with reduced expression of inflammatory\\nmarkers in the liver and reduced infiltration of macrophages, suggesting an\\noverall suppression of hepatic inflammation. We also showed altered expression of\\ngenes associated with gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, suggesting that\\nglucose and lipid synthesis is suppressed. These findings suggest that apoA-I\\nmimetic peptides could be a new therapeutic option to reduce hepatic inflammation\\nthat contributes to the development of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance.',\n",

This variant is loss-of-expression and\\nloss-of-function in the patients' fibroblasts, which display AD JNK1 deficiency\\nby haploinsufficiency. These cells have impaired, but not abolished, responses to\\nIL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, the development of the patients' TH17 cells was\\nimpaired ex vivo and in vitro, probably due to the involvement of JNK1 in the\\nTGF-β-responsive pathway and further accounting for the patients' CMC.\\nConsistently, the patients' fibroblasts displayed impaired JNK1- and\\nc-Jun/ATF-2-dependent induction of key extracellular matrix (ECM) components and \\nregulators, but not of EDS-causing gene products, in response to TGF-β.\\nFurthermore, they displayed a transcriptional pattern in response to TGF-β\\ndifferent from that of fibroblasts from patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome caused\\nby mutations of TGFBR2 or SMAD3, further accounting for the patients' complex and\\nunusual CTD phenotype.

Sinoatrial node (SAN) adenosine A1 receptors (ADO A1Rs) are\\nupregulated in HF, and adenosine is known to exert negative chronotropic effects \\non the SAN. Here, we investigated the role of A1R signaling at physiologically\\nrelevant ADO concentrations on HF SAN pacemaker cells.\\nMAIN METHODS: Dogs with tachypacing-induced chronic HF and normal controls (CTL) \\nwere studied. SAN tissue was collected for A1R and GIRK mRNA quantification. SAN \\ncells were isolated for perforated patch clamp recordings and firing rate (bpm), \\nslope of slow diastolic depolarization (SDD), and maximum diastolic potential\\n(MDP) were measured. Action potentials (APs) and currents were recorded before\\nand after addition of 1 and 10\\u202fμM ADO.

However, the low-frequency cortical phase exhibits great\\nflexibility in response to external influences. Given that brain rhythms have\\nbeen found to track respiratory inputs, we hypothesized that slow breathing,\\ncommonly associated with mental regulation, could reorganize the relationship\\nbetween these two rhythmic systems through the adjustment of the cortical phase\\nto such a slow train of inputs. Based on simultaneous magnetoencephalography and \\nrespiratory measurements, we report that while participants performed paced\\nbreathing, slow relative to normal breathing modulated cortical phase activity in\\nthe alpha range across widespread brain areas. Such modulation effects were\\nspecifically locked to the middle of the inspiration stage and exhibited a\\nwell-structured pattern. At the single-subject level, the phase angles underlying\\nthe effects became more likely to be diametrically opposed across breaths,\\nindicating unique and consistent phase adjustment to slow inspiratory inputs.\\nNeither cardiac fluctuations nor breathing-unrelated task effects could account\\nfor the findings.

Then, we classified whether each participant experienced\\na craving for gaming in the third experiment using various classifiers-the\\nsupport vector machine, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), centroid displacement-based\\nkNN, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest-trained with the\\nphysiological signals recorded during the first or second experiment.\\nConsequently, the craving/non-craving states in the third experiment were\\nclassified with an accuracy that was comparable to that achieved using the data\\nof the same day; thus, demonstrating a high test-retest reliability and the\\npracticality of our craving detection method. In addition, the classification\\nperformance was further enhanced by using both datasets of the first and second\\nexperiments to train the classifiers, suggesting that an individually customized \\ngame craving detection system with high accuracy can be implemented by\\naccumulating datasets recorded on different days under different experimental\\nconditions.',\n",
       "       'Muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy are intractable diseases and their \\ntreatment options are very limited. Transient receptor potential cation channel\\nsubfamily V, member 2 (TRPV2), is a stretch-sensitive Ca2+-permeable channel that\\ncauses sustained intracellular Ca2+ increase in muscular cells, which is a\\npathophysiological feature of degenerative muscular disease. Recent reports have \\nclarified that TRPV2 is concentrated and activated in the sarcolemma of\\ncardiomyocytes/myocytes during cardiomyopathy/heart failure and muscular\\ndystrophy. Furthermore, these reports showed that inactivation of TRPV2\\nameliorates muscle dysgenesis to improve cardiac function and survival prognosis.\\nAlthough TRPV2 is a potential therapeutic target for cardiomyopathy, there were\\nno TRPV2 inhibitors available until recently. In this review, we introduce our\\nrecent findings and discuss the current progress in the development of TRPV2\\ninhibitors and their therapeutic applications for cardiomyopathy associated with \\nmuscular dystrophy.',\n",
       "       'Comment in\\n    Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2020 Jan 1;201(1):6-7.\\n\\nRationale: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early\\nmorbidity and mortality after lung transplantation, but the immunologic\\nmechanisms are poorly understood. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a heterogeneous\\nfamily of immune cells regulating pathologic inflammation and beneficial tissue\\nrepair. However, whether changes in donor-derived lung ILC populations are\\nassociated with PGD development has never been examined.Objectives: To determine \\nwhether PGD in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease\\ntransplant recipients is associated with alterations in ILC subset composition\\nwithin the allograft.Methods: We performed a single-center cohort study of lung\\ntransplantation patients with surgical biopsies of donor tissue taken before, and\\nimmediately after, allograft reperfusion. Donor immune cells from 18 patients\\nwere characterized phenotypically by flow cytometry for single-cell resolution of\\ndistinct ILC subsets. Changes in the percentage of ILC subsets with reperfusion\\nor PGD (grade 3 within 72 h) were assessed.Measurements and Main Results:\\nAllograft reperfusion resulted in significantly decreased frequencies of natural \\nkiller cells and a trend toward reduced ILC populations, regardless of diagnosis \\n(interstitial lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Seven\\npatients developed PGD (38.9%), and PGD development was associated with selective\\nreduction of the ILC2 subset after reperfusion. Conversely, patients without PGD \\nexhibited significantly higher ILC1 frequencies before reperfusion, accompanied\\nby elevated ILC2 frequencies after allograft reperfusion.Conclusions: The\\ncomposition of donor ILC subsets is altered after allograft reperfusion and is\\nassociated with PGD development, suggesting that ILCs may be involved in\\nregulating lung injury in lung transplant recipients.',\n",
       "       'Numerous studies have presented that curcumin could have a positive effect in the\\nprevention of cancer and then in tumor therapy. Several hypotheses have\\nhighlighted that curcumin could decreases tumor growth and invasion by acting on \\nboth chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. This review focuses on the\\ninterest of use curcumin in cancer therapy by acting on the WNT/β-catenin pathway\\nto repress chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. In the cancer process, one \\nof the major signaling pathways involved is the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which\\nappears to be upregulated. Curcumin administration participates to the\\ndownregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and thus, through this action, in\\ntumor growth control. Curcumin act as PPARγ agonists. The WNT/β-catenin pathway\\nand PPARγ act in an opposed manner. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and\\ncircadian clock disruption are common and co-substantial pathological processes\\naccompanying and promoting cancers. Circadian clock disruption related to the\\nupregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway is involved in cancers. By stimulating \\nPPARγ expression, curcumin can control circadian clocks through the regulation of\\nmany key circadian genes. The administration of curcumin in cancer treatment\\nwould thus appear to be an interesting therapeutic strategy, which acts through\\ntheir role in regulating WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ activity levels.',\n",
       "       'The lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) also known as lysine\\n(K)-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A) is a central epigenetic regulator of\\nmetabolic reprogramming in obesity-associated diseases, neurological disorders,\\nand cancer. Here, we evaluated the ability of oleacein, a biophenol secoiridoid\\nnaturally present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), to target LSD1. Molecular\\ndocking and dynamic simulation approaches revealed that oleacein could target the\\nbinding site of the LSD1 cofactor flavin adenosine dinucleotide with high\\naffinity and at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, oleacein was\\npredicted to target the interaction of LSD1 with histone H3 and the LSD1\\nco-repressor (RCOR1/CoREST), likely disturbing the anchorage of LSD1 to\\nchromatin. AlphaScreen-based in vitro assays confirmed the ability of oleacein to\\nact as a direct inhibitor of recombinant LSD1, with an IC50 as low as 2.5 μmol/L.\\nFurther, oleacein fully suppressed the expression of the transcription factor\\nSOX2 (SEX determining Region Y-box 2) in cancer stem-like and induced pluripotent\\nstem (iPS) cells, which specifically occurs under the control of an LSD1-targeted\\ndistal enhancer. Conversely, oleacein failed to modify ectopic SOX2\\noverexpression driven by a constitutive promoter. Overall, our findings provide\\nthe first evidence that EVOO contains a naturally occurring phenolic inhibitor of\\nLSD1, and support the use of oleacein as a template to design new\\nsecoiridoid-based LSD1 inhibitors.',\n",
       "       \"Vasicinone is a quinazoline alkaloid isolated from the Adhatoda vasica plant. In \\nthis study, we explored the neuroprotective effect and underlying molecular\\nmechanism of vasicinone against paraquat-induced cellular apoptosis in SH-SY5Y\\ncells. Vasicinone reduced the paraquat-induced loss of cell viability, rescued\\nterminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling\\n(TUNEL)-positive apoptotic nuclei, and suppressed generation of reactive oxygen\\nspecies (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis revealed that\\nvasicinone increased the phosphorylation of IGF1R/PI3K/AKT cell survival\\nsignaling molecules and downregulated the paraquat-induced, mitogen-activated\\nprotein kinase (MAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptotic pathways\\ncompared to that observed in cells not treated with vasicinone. This protection\\ndepended critically on the activation of IGF1R, and the silencing of IGF1R by\\nsiRNA completely abrogated the protective effect of vasicinone in SH-SY5Y cells. \\nOur findings indicated that vasicinone is a potential candidate for the treatment\\nof Parkinson's disease and possibly other oxidative stress-related\\nneurodegenerative disorders.\",\n",
       "       'Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is one of the most\\nimportant strategies for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. However, in \\nclinical practice, a high proportion of patients do not achieve recommended LDL-C\\nlevels through lifestyle and lipid-lowering therapy with statins and ezetimibe.\\nPCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are a new therapeutic option that significantly\\n(50-60%) reduces LDL-C levels, which in clinical trials translates into an\\nadditional reduction in risk for cardiovascular events, and has a good safety\\nprofile. However, it is a high-cost therapy, and therefore its use in clinical\\npractice should take its cost-effectiveness into account. Priority should be\\ngiven to use in patients at higher cardiovascular risk and those in whom high\\nLDL-C levels persist despite optimal lipid-lowering therapy.
