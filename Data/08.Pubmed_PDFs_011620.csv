which patients might benefit most from certain therapies, and is relevant to
payers' demands to justify clinical and economic value. To understand the
robustness of risk prediction models for heart failure (HF), we conducted a
systematic literature review to (1) identify HF risk-prediction models, (2)
assess statistical approach and extent of validation, (3) identify common
variables, and (4) assess risk of bias (ROB).
METHODS: Literature databases were searched from March 2013 to May 2018 to
identify risk prediction models conducted in an out-of-hospital setting in adults
with HF. Distinct risk prediction variables were ranked according to outcomes
assessed and incorporation into the studies. ROB was assessed using Prediction
model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST).
RESULTS: Of 4720 non-duplicated citations, 40 risk-prediction publications were
deemed relevant. Within the 40 publications, 58 models assessed 55 (co)primary
outcomes, including all-cause mortality (n = 17), cardiovascular death (n = 9),
HF hospitalizations (n = 15), and composite endpoints (n = 14). Few publications 
reported detail on handling missing data (n = 11; 28%). The discriminatory
ability for predicting all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and composite
endpoints was generally better than for HF hospitalization. 105 distinct
predictor variables were identified. Predictors included in >5 publications were:
N-terminal prohormone brain-natriuretic peptide, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,
systolic blood pressure, sodium, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction, 
heart rate, and characteristics including male sex, diabetes, age, and BMI. Only 
11/58 (19%) models had overall low ROB, based on our application of PROBAST. In
total, 26/58 (45%) models discussed internal validation, and 14/58 (24%) external
validation.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the 58 identified risk-prediction models for HF
present particular concerns according to ROB assessment, mainly due to lack of
validation and calibration. The potential utility of novel approaches such as
machine learning tools is yet to be determined.

improved extraction of important functional and morphological features for
cardiovascular disease staging. Segmentation of ventricular cavities and
myocardium in cardiac cine sequencing provides a basis to quantify cardiac
measures such as ejection fraction. A method is presented that curtails the
expense and observer bias of manual cardiac evaluation by combining semantic
segmentation and disease classification into a fully automatic processing
pipeline. The initial processing element consists of a robust dilated
convolutional neural network architecture for voxel-wise segmentation of the
myocardium and ventricular cavities. The resulting comprehensive volumetric
feature matrix captures diagnostic clinical procedure data and is utilized by the
final processing element to model a cardiac pathology classifier. Our approach
evaluated anonymized cardiac images from a training data set of 100 patients (4
pathology groups, 1 healthy group, 20 patients per group) examined at the
University Hospital of Dijon. The top average Dice index scores achieved were
0.940, 0.886, and 0.849 for structure segmentation of the left ventricle (LV),
myocardium, and right ventricle (RV), respectively. A 5-ary pathology
classification accuracy of 90% was recorded on an independent test set using the

an essential component of the interventional cardiology toolbox. However, despite
long-term data demonstrating improved outcomes, physiology-guided percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) remains underutilized in current practice. This
review outlines the indications and technical aspects involved in evaluating
coronary stenosis physiology, focusing on the latest developments in the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: Beyond fractional flow reserve (FFR), non-hyperemic pressure
ratios (NHPR) that assess coronary physiology at rest without hyperemia now
abound. Additional advances in other alternative FFR approaches, including
non-invasive coronary CT (FFRCT), invasive angiography (FFRangio), and optical
coherence tomography (FFROCT), are being realized. Artificial intelligence
algorithms and robust tools that enable detailed pre-procedure ""virtual""
intervention are also emerging. The benefits of coronary physiological assessment
to determine lesion functional significance are well established. In addition to 
stable CAD, coronary physiology can be especially helpful in clinical scenarios
such as left main and multivessel CAD, serial lesions, non-infarct-related
arteries in acute coronary syndromes, and residual ischemia post-PCI. Today,
coronary physiological assessment remains an indispensable tool in the
catheterization laboratory, with an exciting technological future that will
further refine clinical practice and improve patient care.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31938934.pdf

neuroinvasive disease. Susceptible non-human vertebrates are particularly
diverse, ranging from commonly affected birds and horses to less commonly
affected species such as alligators. This review summarizes the pathology caused 
by West Nile virus during natural infections of humans and non-human animals.
While the most well-known findings in human infection involve the central nervous
system, WNV can also cause significant lesions in the heart, kidneys and eyes.
Time has also revealed chronic neurologic sequelae related to prior human WNV
infection. Similarly, neurologic disease is a prominent manifestation of WNV
infection in most non-human non-host animals. However, in some avian species,
which serve as the vertebrate host for WNV maintenance in nature, severe systemic
disease can occur, with neurologic, cardiac, intestinal and renal injury leading 
to death. The pathology seen in experimental animal models of West Nile virus
infection and knowledge gains on viral pathogenesis derived from these animal
models are also briefly discussed. A gap in the current literature exists
regarding the relationship between the neurotropic nature of WNV in vertebrates, 
virus propagation and transmission in nature. This and other knowledge gaps, and

morbidity and mortality. It is the leading risk factor for cardioembolic stroke

prevention. Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is today possible thanks to
consumer-grade wearable devices, enabling transformative diagnostic and patient
management tools. Such monitoring is possible using low-cost easy-to-implement
optical sensors that today equip the majority of wearables. These sensors record 
blood volume variations-a technology known as photoplethysmography (PPG)-from
which the heart rate and other physiological parameters can be extracted to
inform about user activity, fitness, sleep, and health. Recently, new wearable
devices were introduced as being capable of AF detection, evidenced by large
prospective trials in some cases. Such devices would allow for early screening of
AF and initiation of therapy to prevent stroke. This review is a summary of a
body of work on AF detection using PPG. A thorough account of the signal

biological discovery, but the complex nature of the resulting datasets makes it
challenging to perform comprehensive analysis. One particular challenge is the
analysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell
populations and track how they change across time points. To facilitate this
analysis, we developed FLOW-MAP, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based software 
tool that uses graph layout analysis with sequential time ordering to visualize
cellular trajectories in high-dimensional single-cell datasets obtained from flow
cytometry, mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments.
Here we provide a detailed description of the FLOW-MAP algorithm and how to use
the open-source R package FLOWMAPR via its GUI or with text-based commands. This 
approach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell
differentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug
resistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a
step-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from
mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, 
mesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a
previously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental
datasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other
single-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the

DNA from clinical samples, has proved useful for broad-spectrum pathogen
detection and the genomic surveillance of viral outbreaks. An additional target
enrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification 
in low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be
limited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or
cross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer
enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while
simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We
evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment
and mean 47% (±16%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone.
Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was
comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the
detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma 
samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or
co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including
Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE. MSSPE is simple, low

play a key role in pathological processes in asthma. The goal of the current
study is to compare the diagnostic performance of DNAm markers across three
tissues: AECs, nasal epithelial cells (NECs), and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs). Additionally, we focused on the results using the machine learning
algorithm in the context of multi-locus effects to evaluate the diagnostic
performance of the optimal subset of CpG sites. We obtained 74 subjects with
asthma and 41 controls from AECs, 15 subjects with asthma and 14 controls from
NECs, 697 subjects with asthma and 97 controls from PBMCs. Epigenome-wide DNA
methylation levels in AECs, NECs and PBMCs were measured using the Infinium Human
Methylation 450 K BeadChip. Overlap analysis across the three different sample
sources at the locus and pathway levels were studied to investigate shared or
unique pathophysiological processes of asthma across tissues. Using the top 100
asthma-associated methylation markers as classifiers from each dataset, we found 
that both AEC- and NEC-based DNAm signatures exerted a lower classification error
than the PBMC-based DNAm markers (p-value = 0.0002). The area-under-the-curve
(AUC) analysis based on out-of-bag errors using the random forest classification 
algorithm revealed that PBMC-, NEC-, and AEC-based methylation data yielded 31
loci (AUC: 0.87), 8 loci (AUC: 0.99), and 4 loci (AUC: 0.97) from each optimal
subset of tissue-specific markers, respectively. We also discovered the
locus-locus interaction of DNAm levels of the CDH6 gene and RAPGEF3 gene might
interact with each other to jointly predict the risk of asthma - which suggests
the pivotal role of cell-cell junction in the pathological changes of asthma.
Both AECs and NECs might provide better diagnostic accuracy and efficacy levels
than PBMCs. Further research is warranted to evaluate how these tissue-specific
DNAm markers classify and predict asthma risk.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31932625.pdf

toxicity and overall survival (OS) for patients with locally advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, radiation-induced cardiac toxicity
among patients with early-stage NSCLC who have undergone stereotactic ablative
radiotherapy (SABR) has been less well-characterized. Our objective was to assess
the associations between cardiac radiation dosimetry and OS in patients with
early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, 153 patients with early-stage NSCLC had
undergone SABR at a single institution. The maximum dose, mean dose, V10Gy,
V25Gy, and V50Gy to 15 cardiac substructures and the whole heart were analyzed
for their association with OS using the Kaplan-Meier method. An artificial neural
network (ANN) analysis was performed to modulate confounding behaviors of
dosimetric variables to predict for OS.
RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included in the present analysis. The right
ventricle (RV) V10Gy most negatively predicted for OS, such that patients who had
received a RV V10Gy dose < 4% had significantly longer OS than patients who had
received a RV V10Gy does > 4% (5.3 years vs. 2.4 years). On ANN analysis, 74
input features, including cardiac dosimetry parameters, predicted for survival
with a test accuracy of 64.7%. A repeat ANN analysis using dosimetry to dose
neutral structure confirmed the predictive power of cardiac dosimetry.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac dosimetry to subvolumes of the heart was associated with
decreased OS in patients with early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR. These data
support the importance of minimizing the radiation dose to cardiac substructures.
Further prioritizing the heart as an organ at risk might be warranted.
Additionally, cardiac follow-up should be considered.

Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling as a mediator of uremic toxicity.
However, details about its tissue-specific and time-dependent activation in
response to various renal pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, a
comprehensive analysis of AHR induction was conducted in response to discrete
models of kidney diseases using a transgenic mouse line expressing the AHR
responsive-promoter tethered to a β-galactosidase reporter gene. Following
validation using a canonical AHR ligand (a dioxin derivative), the transgenic
mice were subjected to adenine-induced and ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury
models representing CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI), respectively, in humans.
Indoxyl sulfate was artificially increased in mice through the drinking water and
by inhibiting its excretion into the urine. Adenine-fed mice showed a distinct
and significant increase in β-galactosidase in the proximal and distal renal
tubules, cardiac myocytes, hepatocytes, and microvasculature in the cerebral
cortex. The pattern of β-galactosidase increase coincided with the changes in
serum indoxyl sulfate levels. Machine-learning-based image quantification
revealed positive correlations between indoxyl sulfate levels and β-galactosidase
expression in various tissues. This pattern of β-galactosidase expression was
recapitulated in the indoxyl sulfate-specific model. The ischemia/reperfusion
injury model showed increase in β-galactosidase in renal tubules that persisted
despite reduction in serum indoxyl sulfate and blood urea nitrogen levels. Thus, 
our results demonstrate a relationship between AHR activation in various tissues 
of mice with CKD or AKI and the levels of indoxyl sulfate. This study
demonstrates the use of a reporter gene mouse to probe tissue-specific
manifestations of uremia in translationally relevant animal models and provide
hypothesis-generating insights into the mechanism of uremic toxicity that warrant
further investigation.

abnormal cardiac structure and function. Early screening of HF has important

signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of

was adopted to segment HS frames. Normalized frames were taken as the input of
the proposed model which can automatically learn the deep features and complete
the HF screening without de-nosing and hand-crafted feature extraction.
RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of proposed model, three methods are used
for comparison. The results show that the GRU model gives a satisfactory
performance with average accuracy of 98.82%, which is better than other

improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment. We explored here how
unsupervised data-driven metabolic subgrouping, based on comprehensive
lipoprotein subclass data, would work in large-scale population cohorts.
METHODS: We applied a self-organizing map (SOM) artificial intelligence
methodology to define subgroups based on detailed lipoprotein profiles in a
population-based cohort (n = 5789) and utilised the trained SOM in an independent
cohort (n = 7607). We identified four SOM-based subgroups of individuals with
distinct lipoprotein profiles and CHD risk and compared those to univariate
subgrouping by apolipoprotein B quartiles.
RESULTS: The SOM-based subgroup with highest concentrations for non-HDL measures 
had the highest, and the subgroup with lowest concentrations, the lowest risk for
CHD. However, apolipoprotein B quartiles produced better resolution of risk than 
the SOM-based subgroups and also striking dose-response behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the majority of lipoprotein-mediated CHD 
risk is explained by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles.
Therefore, even advanced multivariate subgrouping, with comprehensive data on
lipoprotein metabolism, may not advance CHD risk assessment.

and experimental evidence has provided data on a major role of angiopoietin-like 
proteins 3 and 4 (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4) in regulating the activity of lipoprotein 
lipase (LPL), antagonizing the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG). Indeed, beyond
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ASCVD risk is also dependent on a
cluster of metabolic abnormalities characterized by elevated fasting and
post-prandial levels of TG-rich lipoproteins and their remnants. In a
head-to-head comparison between murine models for ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, the former
was found to be a better pharmacological target for the treatment of
hypertriglyceridemia. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 are
associated with a marked reduction of plasma levels of VLDL, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Carriers of
loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL4 show instead lower TG-rich lipoproteins and
a modest but significant increase of HDL. The relevance of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 as
new therapeutic targets is proven by the development of monoclonal antibodies or 
antisense oligonucleotides. Studies in animal models, including non-human
primates, have demonstrated that short-term treatment with monoclonal antibodies 
against ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 induces activation of LPL and a marked reduction of
plasma TG-rich-lipoproteins, apparently without any major side effects.
Inhibition of both targets also partially reduces LDL-C, independent of the LDL
receptor. Similar evidence has been observed with the antisense oligonucleotide
ANGPTL3-LRX. The genetic studies have paved the way for the development of new
ANGPTL3 and 4 antagonists for the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemias.
Conclusive data of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are still needed in order to
define their safety and efficacy profile.

the breast cancer oncogene IKKε and its downstream target-the serine biosynthesis

amlexanox, an FDA-approved drug targeting IKKε and its homologue TBK1, delayed
in vivo tumour formation in a combined genetic mouse model of breast cancer and
high-fat diet-induced obesity/inflammation. Finally, in human breast cancer
tissues, we validated the link between inflammation-IKKε and alteration of

participants), to obtain an understanding of the patients' perception of using
wearable healthcare technologies. Given that technology anxiety has been shown to
affect users' resistance to using new technology and that perceived ubiquity is
considered a characteristic of wearable devices and other mobile wireless
technologies, we included three external variables: i.e., technology anxiety,
perceived ubiquity, and resistance to change, in addition to the traditional
components of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The results of the
hypothesized model showed that among older adults in general, technology anxiety 
had a negative effect on the perceived ease of use and perceived ubiquity. The
perceived ubiquity construct affects both user groups' perceived ease of use and 
perceived usefulness of wearing smart clothes. Most relationships among the
original constructs of the TAM were validated in older adults in general.
Interestingly, we found that perceived usefulness had an indirect effect on
behavioral intention through attitude. These results further confirm the validity
of the extended TAM in determining older users' technology acceptance behavior.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31929560.pdf

and women in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC). The nutrition transition to 
diets high in salt, fat and sugar and low in fruit and vegetables, in parallel
with increasing prevalence of diet-related CVD risk factors in LMICs, identifies 
the need for urgent action to reverse this trend. To aid identification of the
most effective interventions it is crucial to understand whether there are sex
differences in dietary behaviours related to CVD risk.
METHODS: From a dataset of 46 nationally representative surveys, we included data
from seven countries that had recorded the same dietary behaviour measurements in
adults; Bhutan, Eswatini, Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Nepal and St Vincent and the
Grenadines (2013-2017). Three dietary behaviours were investigated: positive salt
use behaviour (SUB), meeting fruit and vegetable (F&V) recommendations and use of
vegetable oil rather than animal fats in cooking. Generalized linear models were 
used to investigate the association between dietary behaviours and waist
circumference (WC) and undiagnosed and diagnosed hypertension and diabetes.
Interaction terms between sex and dietary behaviour were added to test for sex
differences.
RESULTS: Twenty-four thousand three hundred thirty-two participants were
included. More females than males reported positive SUB (31.3 vs. 27.2% p-value
< 0.001), yet less met F&V recommendations (13.2 vs. 14.8%, p-value< 0.05). The
prevalence of reporting all three dietary behaviours in a positive manner was
2.7%, varying by country, but not sex. Poor SUB was associated with a higher
prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension for females (13.1% vs. 9.9%,
p-value = 0.04), and a higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for males (2.4% 
vs. 1.5%, p-value = 0.02). Meeting F&V recommendations was associated with a
higher prevalence of high WC (24.4% vs 22.6%, p-value = 0.01), but was not
associated with undiagnosed or diagnosed hypertension or diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to increase F&V intake and positive SUBs in the
included countries are urgently needed. Dietary behaviours were not notably
different between sexes. However, our findings were limited by the small
proportion of the population reporting positive dietary behaviours, and further
research is required to understand whether associations with CVD risk factors and
interactions by sex would change as the prevalence of positive behaviours
increases.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31928531.pdf

oestrogen plus progestogen and 3) placebo on plasma lipid and lipoprotein markers
of cardiovascular risk in healthy post-menopausal women.
STUDY DESIGN: randomised, single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
PATIENTS: 101 post-menopausal women were randomised (1:1:1) into one of three
groups taking daily 2.5mg tibolone, continuous oral oestradiol-17β 2mg plus
norethisterone acetate 1mg daily (E2 /NETA) or placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting serum lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein
concentrations measured at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment.
RESULTS: Both tibolone and E2 /NETA lowered plasma total cholesterol
concentrations relative to placebo. With tibolone, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced (-27% at 24 months, p<0.001), the greatest effect
being in the cholesterol-enriched HDL2 subfraction (-40%, p<0.001). Tibolone's
effect on HDL concentrations was also apparent in the principal HDL protein
component, apolipoprotein AI (-29% at 24 months, p<0.001). However, there was no 
significant effect of tibolone on low-density or very-low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C and VLDL-C, respectively). By contrast, the greatest reduction
in cholesterol with E2 /NETA was in LDL-C (-22% at 24 months, p=0.008). E2 /NETA 
reduced HDL-C to a lesser extent than tibolone (-12% at 24 months, p<0.001).
Effects on HDL apolipoproteins were similarly diminished relative to tibolone. E2
/NETA had no effect on VLDL-C or on the protein component of LDL, apolipoprotein 
B.
CONCLUSION: Tibolone reduces serum HDL. E2 /NETA reduces LDL cholesterol but not 
apolipoprotein B, suggesting decreased cholesterol loading of LDL. Any impact
these changes may have on CVD risk needs further investigation.

RECENT FINDINGS: In 2013, The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College
of Cardiology (ACC) assigned an ejection fraction (EF) range to heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF ≤ 40%) and heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF ≥50%). This classification created a ""gray zone"" of 
patients with EFs between 41% and 49% that ultimately came to be known as heart
failure with borderline or mid-range ejection fraction. HFmrEF patients represent
a group with heterogeneous clinical characteristics that at times resembles
HFrEF, at others HFpEF, and at others still a unique phenotype altogether. No
randomized controlled trials exist in those with HFmrEF, though HFrEF and HFpEF
studies that include overlap suggest some potential benefit of beta blockers,
angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors. Mortality rates among the HFmrEF
population are significant, and are similar to those in patients with HFrEF and
HFpEF. HFmrEF is a complex disorder that remains poorly understood. Future
research is needed to better elucidate the pathophysiology, management, and

and considered as a major predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD). AS is
measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), particularly when this

very high levels of accuracy.
RECENT FINDINGS: PWV index may so constitute a substantial marker of large
arteries prediction and damage in CHD and may be also used in cerebrovascular and
renal circulations models. PWV index determinations are particularly relevant to 
consider in angiographic CHD decisions and in the presence of vulnerable plaques

characteristics of patients, together with some imperfections in results, there
is no very simple adequate diagnosis approach enabling to improve the so defined

biocompatible shell. With a rheology comparable to that of red blood cells, UCAs 
provide an intravascular indicator for functional imaging of the

intravascular kinetics have been proposed to provide functional quantitative
maps, aiding diagnosis of different pathological conditions. This article is a
comprehensive review of the available methods for quantitative DCE-US imaging
based on temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal analysis of the UCA kinetics. The
recent introduction of novel UCAs that are targeted to specific vascular
receptors has advanced DCE-US to a molecular imaging modality. In parallel, new
kinetic models of increased complexity have been developed. The extraction of
multiple quantitative maps, reflecting complementary variables of the underlying 
physiological processes, requires an integrative approach to their
interpretation. A probabilistic framework based on emerging machine-learning

has substantially decreased, but post-AMI cardiac remodeling remains an important
factor affecting patient prognosis. Several circulating long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are reportedly involved in the chronic pathological process of cardiac 
function and remodeling in cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential roles 
of these circulating lncRNAs as biomarkers of cardiac function and remodeling
during early-stage AMI remain unclear.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients with AMI and 90 controls without AMI were
consecutively enrolled in this study. Clinical parameters and blood samples at
different time points (i.e., 24 h and 3 days) were collected.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the circulating levels of cardiac
hypertrophy-associated transcript (CHAST) significantly increased in AMI
patients, and the CHAST levels obviously decreased at 3 days. In AMI patients,
the expression levels of CHAST at 24 h were positively associated with cardiac
contractile function and measured as left ventricular ejection fraction and left 
ventricular short-axis shortening rate (all P < 0.050). Multivariate regression
analysis indicated that the expression level of CHAST at 24 h was an independent 
predictor of cardiac contractile function (standardized β = 0.319, P =0.034).
When grouped according to the quartile values of the CHAST in the AMI population,
patients with the highest quartiles of CHAST expression level showed better
cardiac contractile function than all the other quartiles (all P < 0.050).
CONCLUSION: CHAST was an independent predictor of cardiac contractile function at
early-stage AMI and may serve as a candidate biomarker for cardiac remodeling.

based on comprehensive multimodal health assessments. Integrated analysis of data
from different modalities has the potential of uncovering novel biomarkers and
disease signatures.
METHODS: We collected 1385 data features from diverse modalities, including
metabolome, microbiome, genetics, and advanced imaging, from 1253 individuals and
from a longitudinal validation cohort of 1083 individuals. We utilized a
combination of unsupervised machine learning methods to identify multimodal
biomarker signatures of health and disease risk.
RESULTS: Our method identified a set of cardiometabolic biomarkers that goes
beyond standard clinical biomarkers. Stratification of individuals based on the
signatures of these biomarkers identified distinct subsets of individuals with
similar health statuses. Subset membership was a better predictor for diabetes
than established clinical biomarkers such as glucose, insulin resistance, and
body mass index. The novel biomarkers in the diabetes signature included
1-stearoyl-2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC and 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC. Another
metabolite, cinnamoylglycine, was identified as a potential biomarker for both
gut microbiome health and lean mass percentage. We identified potential early
signatures for hypertension and a poor metabolic health outcome. Additionally, we

Different
clinical phenotypes for food allergy are likely to exist, in much the same way as
endotype discovery is now a major research theme in asthma. We discuss the
emerging evidence for different reaction phenotypes i.e. symptoms experienced
following allergen exposure in food-allergic individuals, and their relevance for
clinical practice.
DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished literature relating to reaction
phenotypes in food allergy. Study Selections Authors assessment of the available 
data.
RESULTS: Food anaphylaxis may have a different pathophysiology to anaphylaxis
caused by nonfood triggers. Currently, there are no robust, clinically useful
predictors of severity in food allergy. It is likely that patient-specific
reaction phenotypes exist in food allergy, which may impact upon risk of severe
anaphylaxis. Allergen immunotherapy may modulate these phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Data are emerging to confirm our clinical experience that many
food-allergic patients experience stereotypical symptoms following allergen
exposure, both in the community and at supervised oral food challenge, in a
manner that varies from one patient to another. Integrating datasets from
different cohorts and applying unbiased machine-learning analyses may demonstrate
specific food allergy endotypes, in a similar way to asthma. Whether this results
in improvements in patient management (e.g. through facilitating risk
stratification or impacting on the decision to prescribe EAI and, perhaps, the
number of devices) remains to be determined - but given our current inability to 
predict patients most at risk of severe food-allergic reactions, this will
clearly be an important area of research in the future.

parameters of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Multiple ML models were trained on a retrospective database 
of 1510 patients undergoing CRT implantation to predict 1- to 5-year all-cause
mortality. Thirty-three pre-implant clinical features were selected to train the 
models. The best performing model [SEMMELWEIS-CRT score (perSonalizEd assessMent

VALID-CRT, EAARN, ScREEN, and CRT-score), was tested on an independent cohort of 
158 patients. There were 805 (53%) deaths in the training cohort and 80 (51%)
deaths in the test cohort during the 5-year follow-up period. Among the trained
classifiers, random forest demonstrated the best performance. For the prediction 
of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year mortality, the areas under the receiver operating
characteristic curves of the SEMMELWEIS-CRT score were 0.768 (95% CI:
0.674-0.861; P < 0.001), 0.793 (95% CI: 0.718-0.867; P < 0.001), 0.785 (95% CI:

CI: 0.733-0.872; P < 0.001), respectively. The discriminative ability of our
model was superior to other evaluated scores.
CONCLUSION: The SEMMELWEIS-CRT score (available at semmelweiscrtscore.com)
exhibited good discriminative capabilities for the prediction of all-cause death 
in CRT patients and outperformed the already existing risk scores. By capturing
the non-linear association of predictors, the utilization of ML approaches may
facilitate optimal candidate selection and prognostication of patients undergoing
CRT implantation.

alarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using 
single- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature
are either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis
to build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on
hand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to
automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more
emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more 
likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the
temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method
efficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and
fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet
computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that
the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms 
for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a
sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification,
considering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate 
alarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG

(T2DM) prognosis. This multicenter study aimed to investigate blood glucose
control among patients with insulin-treated T2DM in North China and explore the
application value of combining an elastic network (EN) with a machine-learning
algorithm to predict glycemic control.
METHODS: Basic information, biochemical indices, and diabetes-related data were
collected via questionnaire from 2787 consecutive participants recruited from 27 
centers in six cities between January 2016 and December 2017. An EN regression
was used to address variable collinearity. Then, three common machine learning
algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and back
propagation artificial neural network [BP-ANN]) were used to simulate and predict
blood glucose status. Additionally, a stepwise logistic regression was performed 
to compare the machine learning models.
RESULTS: The well-controlled blood glucose rate was 45.82% in North China. The
multivariable analysis found that hypertension history, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease history, exercise, and total cholesterol were protective
factors in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control, while central adiposity,
family history, T2DM duration, complications, insulin dose, blood pressure, and
hypertension were risk factors for elevated HbA1c. Before the dimensional
reduction in the EN, the areas under the curve of RF, SVM, and BP were 0.73,
0.61, and 0.70, respectively, while these figures increased to 0.75, 0.72, and
0.72, respectively, after dimensional reduction. Moreover, the EN and machine
learning models had higher sensitivity and accuracy than the logistic regression

0.70; SVM: 0.84, 0.73; BP-ANN: 0.78, 0.73, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of T2DM patients in North China had poor glycemic
control and were at a higher risk of developing diabetic complications. The EN

traditional logistic model, for building predictive models of blood glucose

Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, top cost
decile, and home days loss greater than 25% were modeled using logistic
regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operation regression,
classification and regression trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted

on the differences when using claims-only vs claims + EMR predictors.
Results: A total of 9502 patients with HF with a mean (SD) age of 78 (8) years
were included: 6113 from network 1 (training set) and 3389 from network 2

vs claims-only GBMs predicting mortality (0.484 vs 0.423), HF hospitalization
(0.413 vs 0.403), and home time loss (0.575 vs 0.521) but not cost (0.249 vs
0.252). The net benefit for claims + EMR vs claims-only GBMs was higher at
various threshold probabilities for mortality and home time loss outcomes but
similar for the other 2 outcomes.
Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning methods offered only limited
improvement over traditional logistic regression in predicting key HF outcomes.

improve prediction for some, but not all, outcomes.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31922560.pdf

cognitive impairment may help predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease
(AD). Neuropsychological (NP) testing is an attractive modality for screening
early evidence of AD.
Methods: Longitudinal NP and demographic data from the Framingham Heart Study
(FHS; N = 1696) and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; N = 689) 
were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning framework. Features,
including age, logical memory-immediate and delayed recall, visual
reproduction-immediate and delayed recall, the Boston naming tests, and Trails B,
were identified using feature selection, and processed further to predict the
risk of development of AD.
Results: Our model yielded 83.07 ± 3.52% accuracy in FHS and 87.57 ± 1.19%
accuracy in NACC, 80.52 ± 3.93%, 86.74 ± 1.63% sensitivity in FHS and NACC
respectively, and 85.63 ± 4.71%, 88.41 ± 1.38% specificity in FHS and NACC,
respectively.
Discussion: Our results suggest that a subset of NP tests, when analyzed using
unsupervised machine learning, may help distinguish between high- and low-risk
individuals in the context of subsequent development of AD within 5 years. This
approach could be a viable option for early AD screening in clinical practice and
clinical trials.

cardiovascular and kidney diseases; hereafter referred to as HND (heart/cardiac-,
nephrology-, diabetes mellitus-) patients, are high utilizers of health care.
However, the care received is often insufficiently coordinated between different 
specialties and health-care providers. This study aims to describe the
characteristics of HND patients and to explore the initial effects of a
multidisciplinary and person-centered care on total care utilization.
Patients and Methods: We conducted a sub-study of HND patients recruited in an
ongoing randomized trial CareHND (NCT03362983). Descriptive statistics of patient
characteristics, including diagnostic data and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores,
informed a comparison of care utilization patterns between HND patient care and
traditional care. Diagnostic and care utilization data were collected from a
regional database. Wilcoxon signed ranked sum tests were performed to compare
care utilization frequencies between the two groups.
Results: Patients included in the study were care-intensive with several
diagnoses and experienced a high level of variation in care utilization and
diagnoses profiles. HND patients were sicker than their counterparts in the
control group. Utilization indicators were similar between the two arms. There
was some indication that the HND center is beginning to perform as expected, but 
no results were statistically significant.
Conclusion: This study sits among many studies reporting difficulties obtaining
statistically significant findings for MCC patients. However, previous research
has shown that the key components of this intervention, such as integrated,
multidisciplinary, inter-professional collaboration within patient-centered care 
have had a positive effect on health-care outcomes. More innovative methods
beyond the RCT, such as machine learning should be explored to evaluate the
impact of integrated care interventions on care utilization.

considerable overlap in QT-interval between LQTS and healthy subjects.
Characterizing T-wave morphology might improve LQTS diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To improve LQTS diagnosis by combining new polynomial-based T-wave
morphology parameters with the corrected QT-interval (QTc), age and sex in a
model.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort consisting of 333 LQTS patients and 345
genotype-negative family members was used in this study. For each patient, a
linear combination of the first 2 Hermite-Gauss (HG) polynomials was fitted to
the STT-segments of an average complex of all precordial leads and limb leads I
and II. The weight coefficients as well as the error of the best fit were used to
characterize T-wave morphology. Subjects were classified as LQTS or controls by
clinical QTc cut-offs and three support-vector-machine (SVM) models fed with
different features. An external cohort consisting of 72 patients and 45 controls 
was finally used to check the robustness of the models.
RESULTS: Baseline QTc cut-offs were specific but had low sensitivity in
diagnosing LQTS. The model with T-wave morphology features, QTc, age and sex had 
the best overall accuracy (84%) followed by a model with QTc, age and sex (79%). 
The Extended model especially performed better in LQT-3 patients (69%).
CONCLUSION: T-wave morphologies can be characterized by fitting a linear
combination of the first 2 HG-polynomials. Adding T-wave morphology
characterizations to age, gender and QTc in an SVM-model improves LQTS diagnosis.

Guidelines for the management of heart failure (HF) was released. The aim of this
study was to describe the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction after
the publication of ESC Guidelines.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Linx registry is a multicentre, observational,
cross-sectional study from 14 Catalan hospitals that enrolled 1056 patients with 
HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%) from 1 February to 30
April 2017 in outpatient cardiology clinics. Results were compared between
hospitals according to their level of complexity in our own registry and compared
with previously published registries similar to ours. Sacubitril/valsartan was
prescribed to 23.9% of patients in our population, as a consequence, use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers in
monotherapy decreased to 48.1% and 16.9%, respectively, and prescription of
beta-blockers (91.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (72.7%), and
ivabradine (21.4%) remained similar to previous registries. Target doses of
beta-blockers (25.4%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (24.9%),
angiotensin receptor blockers (7.7%), sacubitril/valsartan (8.1%), and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (19.7%) were accomplished in a low
proportion of patients. Our results also suggest that prescription and
up-titration of class I HF drugs were greater in hospitals with higher level of
complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: The Linx registry shows an appropriate adherence to pharmacological 
recommendations from ESC HF Guidelines despite a low proportion of patients
reached target doses. Almost one-quarter of patients were under treatment with
sacubitril/valsartan a few months after ESC HF Guidelines recommendations.

albuminuria translates into a decreased occurrence of cardiovascular and renal
outcomes.
AIMS: To evaluate the changes in the prevalence of albuminuria in diabetic
hypertensive patients treated with several combinations of renin-angiotensin
aldosterone system with calcium channel blockers.
METHODS: We analysed data from 668 unselected patients from the PAIT survey (mean
age 60.4 ± 10.2 years, prevalence of males 38%), with and without albuminuria,
maintained for 6 months with the previous treatment with amlodipine-valsartan,
amlodipine perindopril, lercanidipine-enalapril, verapamil-trandolapril,
nitrendipine-enalapril and felodipine-ramipril Albuminuria was assessed, as
urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, using a Multistic-Clinitek device analyzer.
Microalbuminuria was defined as a loss of 3.4-33.9 mg albumin/mmol creatinine
(30-300 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria as a loss of > 33.9 mg albumin/mmol creatinine
(> 300 mg/g). Blood pressure was measured with a validated digital device.
RESULTS: At baseline, albuminuria was present in 310 subjects (46.4%)
(microalbuminuria in 263 (84.8%), macroalbuminuria in 15.2%), and
normoalbuminuria in 53.6% 358. After 6 months, the prevalence of subjects with
albuminuria was significantly lowered (p < 0.01) by 23.5% (microalbuminuria
- 23.9%, p < 0.01 and macroalbuminuria - 21.3%). The prevalence of subjects with 
microalbuminuria was reduced with all treatments: amlodipine-valsartan - 15.6%,
amlodipine-perindopril - 11.8%, lercanidipine-enalapril - 41.3% and
verapamil-trandolapril - 19.2%. Data with nitrendipine-enalapril and
felodipine-ramipril were not analyzed, due to the low number of patients. The
frequency of patients with normoalbuminuria was significantly higher (p < 0.01)
with lercanidipine-enalapril compared with any other treatment. Blood pressure
was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced, with a similar effect between treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatments decrease the prevalence of subjects with albuminuria,
showing a significant difference among the different drug combinations, favoring 
the use of new dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as lercanidipine,
combined with RAAS inhibitors, to control albuminuria in diabetic hypertensive

from histopathological images to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from 
adjacent normal tissue and predict the prognosis of HCC patients after surgical
resection.
METHODS: A fully automated pipeline was constructed using computational
approaches to analyze the quantitative features of histopathological slides of
HCC patients, in which the features were extracted from the hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained whole-slide images of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and
tissue microarray images from West China Hospital. The extracted features were
used to train the statistical models that classify tissue slides and predict
patients' survival outcomes by machine-learning methods.
RESULTS: A total of 1733 quantitative image features were extracted from each
histopathological slide. The diagnostic classifier based on 31 features was able 
to successfully distinguish HCC from adjacent normal tissues in both the test
[area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.988] and external
validation sets (AUC 0.886). The random-forest prognostic model using 46 features
was able to significantly stratify patients in each set into longer- or
shorter-term survival groups according to their assigned risk scores. Moreover,
the prognostic model we constructed showed comparable predicting accuracy as TNM 
staging systems in predicting patients' survival at different time points after
surgery.

cardiovascular agents used in elderly people living in nursing homes between 2007
and 2013. Further, the aim was to analyse the use of cardiovascular drugs in
relation to cognitive impairment and associated factors within the same
population, where prescription of loop diuretics was used as a proxy for heart
failure.
METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were performed including 2494 people in 2007
and 1654 people in 2013 living in nursing homes in northern Sweden. Data were
collected concerning drug use, functioning in activities of daily living (ADL)
and cognition, using the Multi-Dimensional Dementia Assessment Scale (MDDAS). The
use of different drugs and drug classes among people at four different levels of 
cognitive function in 2007 and 2013 were compared.
RESULTS: The proportion of people prescribed ASA and diuretics was significantly 
lower at all four levels of cognitive function in 2013 compared to 2007. Among
people prescribed loop diuretics, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs) increased from 37.8 to
45.6%, β-blockers from 36.0 to 41.8% and warfarin from 4.4 to 11.4%. The use of
warfarin, ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)
were less common among individuals with more severe cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that cardiovascular drug treatment has improved 
between 2007 and 2013, but there is room for further improvement, especially
regarding adherence to guidelines for heart failure. Increasing cognitive
impairment had an effect on treatment patterns for heart failure and atrial

protein glycosylation, which is a highly controlled ubiquitous posttranslational 
modification. Here we investigate the ability of the plasma N-glycome to predict 
incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; i.e., myocardial 
infarction and stroke).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on the prospective European Prospective
Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort (n = 27,548), we constructed
case-cohorts including a random subsample of 2,500 participants and all
physician-verified incident cases of type 2 diabetes (n = 820; median follow-up
time 6.5 years) and CVD (n = 508; median follow-up time 8.2 years). Information
on the relative abundance of 39 N-glycan groups in baseline plasma samples was
generated by chromatographic profiling. We selected predictive N-glycans for type
2 diabetes and CVD separately, based on cross-validated machine learning,
nonlinear model building, and construction of weighted prediction scores. This
workflow for CVD was applied separately in men and women.
RESULTS: The N-glycan-based type 2 diabetes score was strongly predictive for
diabetes risk in an internal validation cohort (weighted C index 0.83, 95% CI
0.78-0.88), and this finding was externally validated in the Finland
Cardiovascular Risk Study (FINRISK) cohort. N-glycans were moderately predictive 
for CVD incidence (weighted C indices men: 0.66, 95% CI 0.60-0.72; women: 0.64,
95% CI 0.55-0.73). Information on the selected N-glycans improved the accuracy of
established and clinically applied risk prediction scores for type 2 diabetes and
CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: Selected N-glycans improve type 2 diabetes and CVD prediction beyond
established risk markers. Plasma protein N-glycan profiling may thus be useful
for risk stratification in the context of precisely targeted primary prevention
of cardiometabolic diseases.

affects the quality of life and complicates treatment. Insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF1) is a key positive regulator of muscle mass. The IGF1/Igf1 gene encodes
multiple protein isoforms that differ in tissue expression, potency, and
function, particularly in cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as 
in systemic versus localized signaling. Genome engineering is a novel strategy
for increasing gene expression and has the potential to recapitulate the diverse 
biology seen in IGF1 signaling through the overexpression of multiple IGF1
isoforms. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene activation approach, we showed that the
expression of multiple IGF1 or Igf1 mRNA variants can be increased in human and
mouse skeletal muscle myoblast cell lines using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). We
found increased IGF1 protein levels in the cell culture media and increased
cellular phosphorylation of AKT1, the main effector of IGF1 signaling. We also
showed that the expression of Class 1 or Class 2 mRNA variants can be selectively
increased by changing the sgRNA target location. The expression of multiple IGF1 
or Igf1 mRNA transcript variants in human and mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts
promoted myotube differentiation and prevented dexamethasone-induced atrophy in
myotubes in vitro. Our findings suggest that this novel approach for enhancing
IGF1 signaling has potential therapeutic applications for treating skeletal
muscle atrophy.

University from October 2018 to March 2019. The random phenotype was divided into
dexmedetomidine group (group D, n=60) and control group (group C, n=60). The
elapsed time before postoperative awake and spontaneous breathing recovery and
agitation occurrence were recorded. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate

Dexmedetomidine could attenuate the extent of lung injury in elderly patients
with lung cancer undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy. The pulmonary protective
mechanism could be related to the inhibition of inflammatory factors in

density lipoprotein particles (HDLs). We previously demonstrated that apo-AI
injected directly into high-fat diet fed mice improved insulin sensitivity
associated with decreased hepatic inflammation. While our data provides
compelling proof of concept, apoA-I mimetic peptides are more clinically
feasible. The aim of this study was to test whether apo-AI mimetic peptide (D-4F 
and L-5F) treatment will emulate the effects of full-length apo-AI to improve
insulin sensitivity.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks before receiving
D4F mimetic peptide administered via drinking water or L5F mimetic peptide
administered by intraperitoneal injection bi-weekly for a total of five weeks.
Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were conducted to assess the
effects of the peptides on insulin resistance. Effects of the peptides on
inflammation, gluconeogenic enzymes and lipid synthesis were assessed by
real-time PCR of key markers involved in the respective pathways.
RESULTS: Treatment with apo-AI mimetic peptides D-4F and L-5F showed: (i)
improved blood glucose clearance (D-4F 1.40-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD,
P<0.05; L-4F 1.17-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, ns) in the glucose tolerance
test; (ii) improved insulin tolerance (D-4F 1.63-fold AUC decrease compared to
HFD, P<0.05; L-5F 1.39-fold AUC compared to HFD, P<0.05) in the insulin tolerance
test. The metabolic test results were associated with (i) decreased hepatic
inflammation of SAA1, IL-1β IFN-γ and TNFα (2.61-5.97-fold decrease compared to
HFD, P<0.05) for both mimetics; (ii) suppression of hepatic mRNA expression of
gluconeogenesis-associated genes (PEPCK and G6Pase; 1.66-3.01-fold decrease
compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics; (iii) lipogenic-associated genes,
(SREBP1c and ChREBP; 2.15-3.31-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both
mimetics and; (iv) reduced hepatic macrophage infiltration (F4/80 and CD68;
1.77-2.15-fold compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics.
CONCLUSION: Apo-AI mimetic peptides treatment led to improved glucose
homeostasis. This effect is associated with reduced expression of inflammatory
markers in the liver and reduced infiltration of macrophages, suggesting an
overall suppression of hepatic inflammation. We also showed altered expression of
genes associated with gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, suggesting that

plasma membrane, orchestrating many cellular processes including cell volume
regulation, hormone secretion and electrical impulse formation. Ligand peptides
of potassium channels are molecules used in basic and applied research and are
now considered promising alternatives in the treatment of many diseases, such as 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Currently, there are various bioinformatics
tools focused on the prediction of peptides with different activities. However,
none of the current tools can predict ligand peptides of potassium channels. In
this work, we developed a tool called PPLK+C; this is the first tool that can
predict peptide ligands of potassium channels. We also evaluated several amino
acid molecular features and four machine-learning algorithms for the prediction
of potassium channel ligand peptides: random forest, nearest neighbors, support
vector machine and artificial neural network. All the biological data used in
this study for training and validating models were obtained from peptides with
experimentally verified activity. PPLK+C is a bioinformatics software written in 
the Python programming language, which showed a high predictive capacity with a
model generated with the random forest algorithm: 0.77 sensitivity, 0.94
specificity, 0.91 accuracy and 0.70 Matthews correlation coefficient. PPLK+C is a
novel tool with a friendly interface that can be used for the discovery of novel

heterogeneous syndrome. We aimed to derive HFpEF phenotype-based groups
('phenogroups') based on clinical and echocardiogram data using machine learning,
and to compare clinical characteristics, proteomics and outcomes across the
phenogroups.
METHODS: We applied model-based clustering to 32 echocardiogram and 11 clinical
and laboratory variables collected in stable condition from 320 HFpEF outpatients
in the Karolinska-Rennes cohort study (56% female, median 78 years (IQR: 71-83)).
Baseline proteomics and the composite end point of all-cause mortality or heart
failure (HF) hospitalisation were used in secondary analyses.
RESULTS: We identified six phenogroups, for which significant differences in the 
prevalence of concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF), anaemia and kidney disease
were observed (p<0.05). Fifteen out of 86 plasma proteins differed between
phenogroups (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05), including biomarkers of HF, AF and 
kidney function. The composite end point was significantly different between
phenogroups (log-rank p<0.001), at short-term (100 days), mid-term (18 months)
and longer-term follow-up (1000 days). Phenogroup 2 was older, with poorer
diastolic and right ventricular function and higher burden of risk factors as AF 
(85%), hypertension (83%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30%). In
this group a third experienced the primary outcome to 100 days, and two-thirds to
18 months (HR (95% CI) versus phenogroups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6: 1.5 (0.8-2.9); 5.7
(2.6-12.8); 2.9 (1.5-5.6); 2.7 (1.6-4.6); 2.1 (1.2-3.9)).
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning we identified distinct HFpEF phenogroups with
differential characteristics and outcomes, as well as differential levels of
inflammatory and cardiovascular proteins.

help in the diagnosis and monitoring of fetuses with a compromised cardiovascular
system potentially associated with several fetal conditions. Different ultrasound
approaches are currently used to evaluate fetal cardiac structure and function,
including conventional 2-D imaging and M-mode and tissue Doppler imaging among
others. However, assessment of the fetal heart is still challenging mainly due to
involuntary movements of the fetus, the small size of the heart, and the lack of 
expertise in fetal echocardiography of some sonographers. Therefore, the use of
new technologies to improve the primary acquired images, to help extract
measurements, or to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities is of great
importance for optimal assessment of the fetal heart. Machine leaning (ML) is a
computer science discipline focused on teaching a computer to perform tasks with 
specific goals without explicitly programming the rules on how to perform this
task. In this review we provide a brief overview on the potential of ML
techniques to improve the evaluation of fetal cardiac function by optimizing
image acquisition and quantification/segmentation, as well as aid in improving
the prenatal diagnoses of fetal cardiac remodeling and abnormalities.

is growing that they can have rapid, non-genomic actions that have been
unappreciated. Diverse cell signaling effects have been reported for
glucocorticoids, leading us to hypothesize that glucocorticoids alone can swiftly
increase the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. We found
that prednisone, fluticasone, budesonide, and progesterone each increased cAMP
levels within 3 minutes without phosphodiesterase inhibitors by measuring
real-time cAMP dynamics using the cAMP difference detector in situ assay in a
variety of immortalized cell lines and primary human airway smooth muscle (HASM) 
cells. A membrane- impermeable glucocorticoid showed similarly rapid stimulation 
of cAMP, implying that responses are initiated at the cell surface. siRNA
knockdown of Gαs virtually eliminated glucocorticoid-stimulated cAMP responses,
suggesting that these drugs activate the cAMP production via a G protein-coupled 
receptor. Estradiol had small effects on cAMP levels but G protein estrogen
receptor antagonists had little effect on responses to any of the glucocorticoids
tested. The genomic and non-genomic actions of budesonide were analyzed by
RNA-Seq analysis of 24 hours treated HASM, with and without knockdown of Gαs . A 
140-gene budesonide signature was identified, of which 48 genes represent a
non-genomic signature that requires Gαs signaling. Collectively, this non-genomic
cAMP signaling modality contributes to one-third of the gene expression changes
induced by glucocorticoid treatment and shifts the view of how this important
class of drugs exerts its effects.

Previously, we identified Protein Kinase C-delta (PKCδ) as an important regulator

anti-inflammatory therapeutics is the risk of immunosuppression and inability to 
effectively clear pathogens. In this study, we investigated whether PKCδ
inhibition prevented organ dysfunction and improved survival without compromising
pathogen clearance. Sprague Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation 
and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Post-surgery, PBS or a PKCδ inhibitor
(200µg/kg) was administered intra-tracheally (IT). At 24 hours post-CLP, there
was evidence of lung and kidney dysfunction. PKCδ inhibition decreased leukocyte 
influx in these organs, decreased endothelial permeability, improved gas
exchange, and reduced blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios indicating organ
protection. PKCδ inhibition significantly decreased bacterial levels in the
peritoneal cavity, spleen and blood but did not exhibit direct bactericidal
properties. Peritoneal chemokine levels, neutrophil numbers, or macrophage
phenotypes were not altered by PKCδ inhibition. Peritoneal macrophages isolated
from PKCδ inhibitor-treated septic rats demonstrated increased bacterial
phagocytosis. Importantly, PKCδ inhibition increased survival. Thus, PKCδ
inhibition improved survival and improved survival was associated with increased 
phagocytic activity, enhanced pathogen clearance, and decreased organ injury.

The main goal of the heart failure treatment is the decrease of mortality and
morbidity, especially improvement of quality of life and decrease of
hospitalisations. ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of the treatment, MRA should
be added to ACEI. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are indicated in the case
of ACE inhibitors intolerance. Betablockers in maximal tolerated doses should be 
added to the renin angiotensin blockade. Diuretics are given to the symptoms
relieve - dyspnoe or oedema. Digoxin is indicated in selected patients. There are
3 new promising groups of drugs: (1) Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor - 
ARNI - Sacubitril/Valsartan can replace the ACEI according to the results of the 
PARADIGM-HF trial. (2) Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in

and discharged from the hospital, the 30-day readmission risk in COPD patients is

walking distance, which are adopted currently by physicians cannot predict the
potential readmission of COPD patients, especially within the 30 days after

physical activity (PA) in daily living with accelerometer-based wrist-worn

models for activity index (AI) and regularity index (RI) and it introduced a new 
parameter, quality of activity (QoA), which incorporates previously proposed
parameters, such as AI and RI, with other activity-based indices to predict the
readmission risk. Data were collected from continuous PA monitoring of 16 COPD

frequent cause of heart failure in Latin America. TNF-α+ monocytes/macrophages
(Mo/Mφ) are associated with inflammatory pathology in chronic CD. In this study, 
we determined the progenitor lineage of Mo/Mφ contributing to inflammation and
examined the regulatory role of SIRT1 in modulating the Mo/Mφ response in Chagas 
disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice were infected with Tc, treated with SIRT1
agonist (SRT1720) after control of acute parasitemia, and monitored during
chronic phase (150 days post-infection). Flow cytometry studies showed an
increase in maturation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived Mo of
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotype in acutely- and
chronically-infected mice; however, these cells were not increased in splenic
compartment of infected mice. Instead, yolk-sac-derived CD11b+ F4/80+ Mo/Mφ were 
increased in sinusoidal compartment of Chagas mice. The splenic CD11b+ F4/80+
Mo/Mφ of Chagas (vs. control) mice exhibited increased mRNA, protein, and surface
expression of markers of proinflammatory phenotype (CD80+/CD64+ > CD200+/CD206+) 
associated with proinflammatory cytokines response (IL-6+TNF-α >> Arg-1+IL-10),
and these were also detected in the myocardium of chronically infected mice.
Infected mice treated with SRT1720 (vs. infected/untreated) exhibited decreased
splenic expansion and myocardial infiltration of proinflammatory Mo/Mφ. SRT1720
did not alter the inherent capability of splenic Mo/Mφ of Chagas mice to respond 
to pathogen stimulus. Instead, SRT1720 dampened the Tc-induced increase in the
expression and/or phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and downstream
transcription factors (Pu.1, c-Myb, and Runx1) involved in Mφ proliferation and
migration and Notch1 involved in functional activation. Studies in cultured Mφ
confirmed the agonistic effects of SIRT1 in controlling the Tc-induced,
FAK-dependent increase in the expression of transcription factors and showed that
SIRT1 agonist and FAK inhibitor abrogated the NF-κB transcriptional activity and 
inflammatory cytokine gene expression in Tc-infected Mφ.
CONCLUSIONS: The proinflammatory Mo/Mφ of yolk sac origin drive the splenic and
tissue inflammatory response in chronic CD. SRT1720 reprogrammed the Tc-induced

have been associated with non-communicable disease (NCD) risk. We examined
whether prevalent mood disorders are associated with incident NCDs and
multimorbidity (accumulation of ≥2 NCDs) in PLWH.
SETTING: Adult HIV clinic cohort in Nashville, Tennessee, between 1998-2015.
METHODS: PLWH with ≥1 year of follow-up in the clinic were assessed for
cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome (any three of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or obesity), chronic kidney and liver disease,
non-AIDS-defining cancers, and dementia. Only mood disorders documented during
the first year of care were included. Cumulative incidence and adjusted subhazard
ratios were calculated for risk of NCDs and multimorbidity with death as a
competing risk. Multivariable Cox models estimated mortality risk following
multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Of 4,140 adults, 24% had a mood disorder diagnosed in the first year of 
care, 51% had ≥1 NCD at baseline, and there were 2588 incident NCDs during the
study period. Mood disorders were associated with increased risk of first NCD

the vascular lumen and calcifications using the pretrained SegNet, convolutional 
neural network, which was refined for our task. We cleaned segmentation results
using conditional random field processing. We evaluated the method on manually
annotated IVOCT volumes of interest (VOIs) without lesions and with
calcifications, lipidous, or mixed lesions. The dataset included 48 VOIs taken
from 34 clinical pullbacks, giving a total of 2640 in vivo images. Annotations
were determined from consensus between two expert analysts. Keeping VOIs intact, 
we performed 10-fold cross-validation over all data. Following segmentation noise
cleaning, we obtained sensitivities of 0.85 ± 0.04 , 0.99 ± 0.01 , and 0.97 ±
0.01 for calcified, lumen, and other tissue classes, respectively. From segmented
regions, we automatically determined calcification depth, angle, and thickness
attributes. Bland-Altman analysis suggested strong correlation between manually
and automatically obtained lumen and calcification attributes. Agreement between 
manually and automatically obtained stent-deployment calcification scores was
good (four of five lesions gave exact agreement). Results are encouraging and
suggest our classification approach could be applied clinically for assessment

simulator using machine learning (ML). Finite element (FE) simulations were
conducted for the LV with different material properties to obtain a training set.
A hyperelastic fiber-reinforced material model was used to describe the passive
behavior of the myocardium during diastole. The active behavior of the heart
resulting from myofiber contractions was added to the passive tissue during
systole. The active and passive properties govern the LV constitutive equation.
These mechanical properties were altered using optimal Latin hypercube design of 
experiments to obtain training FE models with varied active properties (volume
and pressure predictions) and varied passive properties (stress predictions). For
prediction of LV pressures, we used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) and
Cubist, and XGBoost was used for predictions of LV pressures, volumes as well as 
LV stresses. The LV pressure and volume results obtained from ML were similar to 
FE computations. The ML results could capture the shape of LV pressure as well as
LV pressure-volume loops. The results predicted by Cubist were smoother than
those from XGBoost. The mean absolute errors were as follows: XGBoost volume:
1.734 ± 0.584 ml, XGBoost pressure: 1.544 ± 0.298 mmHg, Cubist volume: 1.495 ±
0.260 ml, Cubist pressure: 1.623 ± 0.191 mmHg, myofiber stress: 0.334 ± 0.228
kPa, cross myofiber stress: 0.075 ± 0.024 kPa, and shear stress: 0.050 ± 0.032

FE method. The ML model can be used as a tool to predict LV behavior. Training of
our ML model based on a large group of subjects can improve its predictability
for real world applications.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31903394.pdf

scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the
goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in
machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective 
chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have
been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary
classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show
overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.
RESULTS: The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable 
statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good
results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false
negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size 
of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and
truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score,
by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six

failure population with regards to treatment and patient characteristics and to
investigate the impact of sex on achieved doses of heart failure medications.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1924 patients with heart failure in a regional
hospital were analysed, 622 patients had ejection fraction ≤ 40% of which 30%
were women. In patients with reduced ejection fraction, women were older (79 ± 11
vs. 74 ± 12 years, P < 0.001), had lower body weight (70 ± 17 vs. 86 ± 18 kg, P <
0.001), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (49 ± 24 vs. 71 ± 30
ml/min, P < 0.001) and received lower doses of heart failure medications than
men. Multivariable linear regression on patients with reduced ejection fraction
showed that sex was not associated with achieved dose of any heart failure
medication. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
blockers associated factors were eGFR, systolic blood pressure, age, ejection
fraction, and heart rate. For beta-blockers associated factors were body weight, 
atrial fibrillation and age. For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
associated factors were eGFR, serum potassium, age, systolic blood pressure,
ejection fraction and heart rate.
CONCLUSION: Women with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction were
prescribed lower doses of heart failure medications, were older, had worse renal 
function, and lower body weight than men. Sex was not independently associated
with achieved doses of heart failure medications, instead age, renal function and
body weight explained the differences in treatment.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31897534.pdf

environmental perturbations. Given that infectious agents represent a major type 
of environmental threat, it follows that the autophagy pathway is central to the 
outcome of host-microbe interactions. Detailed molecular studies have revealed
intricate ways in which autophagy suppresses or enhances the fitness of
infectious agents, particularly intracellular pathogens such as viruses that
require the host cell machinery for replication. Findings in animal models have
reinforced the importance of these events that occur within individual cells and 
have extended the role of autophagy to extracellular microbes and immunity at the
whole organism level. These functions impact adaptation to bacteria that are part
of the gut microbiota, which has implications for the etiology of chronic
disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Despite major advances in how
autophagy regulates inflammatory reactions toward microbes, many challenges
remain, including distinguishing autophagy from closely related pathways such as 
LC3-associated phagocytosis. Here, we review the role of autophagy in microbial

(BPE) surgery and the effects of age, comorbidity and preoperative medical
therapy.
DESIGN: A retrospective, population-based cohort study using linked
administrative data.
SETTING: Ontario, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: 52 162 men≥66 years undergoing first BPE surgery between 1 January 
2003 to 31 December 2014.
INTERVENTION: Medical therapy preoperatively and surgery for BPE.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall 30-day
postoperative complication rates. Secondary outcomes included BPE-specific event 
rates (bleeding, infection, obstruction, trauma) and non-BPE specific event rates
(cardiovascular, pulmonary, thromboembolic and renal). Multivariable analysis
examined the association between preoperative medical therapy and postoperative
complication rates.
RESULTS: The 30-day overall complication rate after BPE surgery was 2828
events/10 000 procedures and increased annually over the study period. Receipt of
preoperative α-blocker monotherapy (relative rate (RR) 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09;
p=0.033) and antithrombotic medications (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.31; p<0.0001) 
was associated with increased complication rates. Among the ≥80-year-old group,
the rate of complications increased by 39% from 2003 to 2014 (RR 1.39; 95% CI
1.21 to 1.61; p<0.0001). The mean duration of medical and conservative management
increased by a mean of 2.1 years between 2007 and 2014 (p<0.0001 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day complication rates after BPE surgery have increased
annually between 2003 and 2014. Preoperative medical therapy with alpha blockers 
or antithrombotics was independently associated with higher rates of
complications. Over this time, the duration of conservative therapy also
increased.

field with aspects ranging from image acquisition and analysis to disease
characterization, and evaluation of therapy approaches.The transfer of innovative
new technological and algorithmic solutions into clinical practice is still slow.
In addition to the verification of solutions, their integration in the clinical
processing workflow must be enabled for the assessment of clinical impact and
risks. The goal of our software platform for cardiac image processing - CAIPI -
is to support researchers from different specialties such as imaging physics,
computer science, and medicine by a common extensible platform to address typical
challenges and hurdles in interdisciplinary cardiovascular imaging research. It
provides an integrated solution for method comparison, integrated analysis, and
validation in the clinical context. The interface concept enables a combination
with existing frameworks that address specific aspects of the pipeline, such as
modeling (e.g., OpenCMISS, CARP) or image reconstruction (Gadgetron).
METHODS: In our platform, we developed a concept for import, integration, and
management of cardiac image data. The integration approach considers the
spatiotemporal properties of the beating heart through a specific data model. The
solution is based on MeVisLab and provides functionalities for data retrieval and
storage. Two types of plugins can be added. While ToolPlugins usually provide
processing algorithms such as image correction and segmentation, AnalysisPlugins 
enable interactive data exploration and reporting. GUI integration concepts are
presented for both plugin types. We developed domain-specific reporting and
visualization tools (e.g., AHA segment model) to enable validation studies by
clinical experts. The platform offers plugins for calculating and reporting
quantitative parameters such as cardiac function, which can be used to, e.g.,
evaluate the effect of processing algorithms on clinical parameters. Export
functionalities include quantitative measurements to Excel, image data to PACS,
and STL models to modeling and simulation tools.
RESULTS: To demonstrate the applicability of this concept both for method
development and clinical application, we present use cases representing different
problems along the innovation chain in cardiac MR imaging. Validation of an image
reconstruction method (MRI T1 mapping) Validation of an image correction method
for real-time 2D-PC MRI Comparison of quantification methods for blood flow
analysis Training and integration of machine learning solutions with expert
annotations Clinical studies with new imaging techniques (flow measurements in
the carotid arteries and peripheral veins as well as cerebral spinal fluid).
CONCLUSION: The presented platform can be used in interdisciplinary teams, in
which engineers or data scientists perform the method validation, followed by
clinical research studies in patient collectives. The demonstrated use cases show
how it enables the transfer of innovations through validation in the

FDA-mandated 3 days of telemetry monitoring due to heightened risk of toxicity
within this time period. Although a recommended dose management algorithm for
dofetilide exists, there is a range of real-world approaches to dosing the
medication.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter investigation, clinical data from the
Antiarrhythmic Drug Genetic (AADGEN) study was examined for 354 patients
undergoing dofetilide initiation. Univariate logistic regression identified a
starting dofetilide dose of 500 mcg (OR 5.0, 95%CI 2.5-10.0, p<0.001) and sinus
rhythm at the start of dofetilide loading (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.8-4.2, p<0.001) as
strong positive predictors of successful loading. Any dose-adjustment during
loading (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.12-0.31, p<0.001) and a history coronary artery disease
(OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.19-0.59, p<0.001) were strong negative predictors of successful
dofetilide loading. Based on the observation that any dose adjustment was a
significant negative predictor of successful initiation, we applied multiple
supervised approaches to attempt to predict the dose adjustment decision, but
none of these approaches identified dose adjustments better than a probabilistic 
guess. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis identified 8 clusters as
a reasonable data reduction method. These 8 clusters were then used to define
patient states in a tabular reinforcement learning model trained on 80% of dosing
decisions. Testing of this model on the remaining 20% of dosing decisions
revealed good accuracy of the reinforcement learning model, with only 16/410
(3.9%) instances of disagreement.
CONCLUSIONS: Dose adjustments are a strong determinant of whether patients are
able to successfully initiate dofetilide. A reinforcement learning algorithm
informed by unsupervised learning was able to predict dosing decisions with 96.1%
accuracy. Future studies will apply this algorithm prospectively as a data-driven
decision aid.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31891645.pdf

inducing anti-epileptic drugs), or directly by toxic effects on bone cells
(chemotherapy, phenytoin, or thiazolidinedions, which diverts mesenchymal stem
cells from forming osteoblasts to forming adipocytes). However, besides effects
on the mineralized matrix, interactions with collagen and other parts of the
unmineralized matrix may decrease bone biomechanical competence in a manner that 
may not correlate with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy
absorptiometry (DXA).Some drugs and drug classes may decrease BMD like the
thiazolidinediones and consequently increase fracture risk. Other drugs such as
glucocorticoids may decrease BMD, and thus increase fracture risk. However,
glucocorticoids may also interfere with the unmineralized matrix leading to an
increase in fracture risk, not mirrored in BMD changes. Some drugs such as
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), paracetamol, and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may not per se be associated with bone loss, but

burden to the healthcare system in many developed countries and regions.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has been recognized as effective approach to
cardiovascular disease diagnosis and widely utilized for monitoring personalized 
health conditions.
METHOD: In this study, we present a novel approach to forecasting one-day-forward
wellness conditions for community-dwelling elderly by analyzing single lead short
ECG signals acquired from a station-based monitoring device. More specifically,
exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) method is employed to eliminate the 
high-frequency noise from original signals at first. Then, Fisher-Yates
normalization approach is used to adjust the self-evaluated wellness score

both deep learning-based and traditional machine learning-based methods are

value are 93.21% and 91.98% respectively. The deep learning-based methods, with
the merit of non-hand-crafted engineering, have superior wellness forecasting
performance towards the competitive traditional machine learning-based methods.

obstetricians to evaluate the fetal state. Because of the complexity and
non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines
usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer
variability.
OBJECTIVE: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced
artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist
obstetricians in making objective medical decisions.
METHODS: In this work, we present an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) framework to automatically predict fetal acidemia. After signal
preprocessing, the input 2-dimensional (2D) images are obtained using the
continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which provides a better way to observe and
capture the hidden characteristic information of the FHR signals in both the time
and frequency domains. Unlike the conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, 
this work does not require the execution of complex feature engineering, i.e.,
feature extraction and selection. In fact, 2D CNN model can self-learn useful
features from the input data with the prerequisite of not losing informative
features, representing the tremendous advantage of deep learning (DL) over ML.
RESULTS: Based on the test open-access database (CTU-UHB), after comprehensive
experimentation, we achieved better classification performance using the optimal 
CNN configuration compared to other state-of-the-art methods: the averaged
ten-fold cross-validation of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, quality

prediction of an individual's health state, trajectory, and responses to
treatments. However, the majority of current clinical risk prediction models are 
based on regression approaches or machine learning algorithms that are static,
rather than dynamic. To benefit from the increasing emergence of large,
heterogeneous data sets, such as electronic health records (EHRs), novel tools to
support improved clinical decision making through methods for individual-level
risk prediction that can handle multiple variables, their interactions, and
time-varying values are necessary.
METHODS: We introduce a novel dynamic approach to clinical risk prediction for
survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcomes, called random forest
for SLAM data analysis (RF-SLAM). RF-SLAM is a continuous-time, random forest
method for survival analysis that combines the strengths of existing statistical 
and machine learning methods to produce individualized Bayes estimates of
piecewise-constant hazard rates. We also present a method-agnostic approach for
time-varying evaluation of model performance.
RESULTS: We derive and illustrate the method by predicting sudden cardiac arrest 
(SCA) in the Left Ventricular Structural (LV) Predictors of Sudden Cardiac Death 
(SCD) Registry. We demonstrate superior performance relative to standard random
forest methods for survival data. We illustrate the importance of the number of
preceding heart failure hospitalizations as a time-dependent predictor in SCA
risk assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: RF-SLAM is a novel statistical and machine learning method that
improves risk prediction by incorporating time-varying information and
accommodating a large number of predictors, their interactions, and missing
values. RF-SLAM is designed to easily extend to simultaneous predictions of
multiple, possibly competing, events and/or repeated measurements of discrete or 
continuous variables over time.

significant progress in solving several medical tasks. However, collecting and
annotating large datasets can be a very cumbersome and expensive task. We tackle 
these problems with a virtual database approach where training data is generated 
using computer simulations of related phenomena. Specifically, we concentrate on 
the following problem: can cardiovascular indices such as aortic elasticity,
diastolic and systolic blood pressures and blood flow from heart be predicted
continuously using wearable photoplethysmographic sensors? We simulate the blood 
flow using a haemodynamic model consisting of the entire human circulation.
Repeated evaluation of the simulator allows us to create a database of ""virtual
subjects"" with size that is only limited by available computational resources.
Using this database, we train neural networks to predict the cardiac indices from
photoplethysmographic signal waveform. We consider two approaches: neural
networks based on pre-defined input features and deep convolutional neural
networks taking waveform directly as the input. The performance of the methods is
demonstrated using numerical examples thus carrying out a preliminary assessment 
of the approaches. The results show improvements in accuracy compared to the
previous methods. The improvements are especially significant with indices
related to aortic elasticity and maximum blood flow. The proposed approach would 
provide new means to measure cardiovascular health continuously, for example,

primary care practices in eastern Croatia. The categories of hypertension
duration were defined as <5, 5-10, and >10 years. Data were analyzed by standard 
statistical procedures.
Results: The proportion of women with MS increases in parallel with hypertension 
duration (p = 0.025). Among the examined CV risk factors, significant increase in
parallel with hypertension duration was found for body mass index (p = 0.007) and
triglycerides (p = 0.07). The highest proportion of women with diabetes duration 
of less than 5 years, indicating recent diabetes onset, was found in the category
of hypertension duration of less than 5 years, corresponding with the onset of
hypertension in the time around menopause (p = 0.003). The strongest linear
correlations with BMI and waist circumference were found for total serum

Conclusion: Hypertension onset at the time around menopause appears together with
abdominal obesity and may be a driving force for CV risk factor accumulation in
postmenopausal women.

homeostasis contribute significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life.
MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) signaling is the most well-known
regulator of autophagy, cellular homeostasis, and longevity. The MTOR signaling
consists of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes,
MTORC1 and MTORC2. While MTORC1 is well characterized but the role of MTORC2 in
aging and autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we identified
TGFB-INHB/activin signaling as a novel upstream regulator of MTORC2 to control
autophagy and cardiac health during aging. Using Drosophila heart as a model
system, we show that cardiac-specific knockdown of TGFB-INHB/activin-like protein
daw induces autophagy and alleviates age-related heart dysfunction, including
cardiac arrhythmias and bradycardia. Interestingly, the downregulation of daw
activates TORC2 signaling to regulate cardiac autophagy. Activation of TORC2
alone through overexpressing its subunit protein rictor promotes autophagic flux 
and preserves cardiac function with aging. In contrast, activation of TORC1 does 
not block autophagy induction in daw knockdown flies. Lastly, either daw
knockdown or rictor overexpression in fly hearts prolongs lifespan, suggesting
that manipulation of these pathways in the heart has systemic effects on
longevity control. Thus, our studies discover the TGFB-INHB/activin-mediated
inhibition of TORC2 as a novel mechanism for age-dependent decreases in
autophagic activity and cardiac health.Abbreviations: AI: arrhythmia index;

testing the efficacy of icosapent ethyl has shown dramatic benefit in further
addressing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk beyond
statin therapy not only in those with known ASCVD, but also in diabetic patients 
with multiple risk factors. The past decade also ushered in confirmation of the
inflammation hypothesis of atherosclerosis with the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory
Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) using canakinumab, despite the fact the
therapy was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
cardiovascular risk reduction. Also, to improve our understanding of heart
disease in women, the emergence of novel concepts of ischemia or myocardial
infarction in those with normal or nonobstructive atherosclerotic disease has
been a major advance. Moreover, the past decade brought the emergence of
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody therapy
and the cardiovascular risk reduction benefits seen in the Further Cardiovascular
Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) 
and Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During
Treatment With Alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) trials, providing further
evidence-based therapy for additional reduction of ASCVD risk beyond statin
therapy. The PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have facilitated the attainment of LDL-C
levels never previously thought possible. Finally with the mRNA interference
therapy inclisiran in development, we may soon have a ""vaccine-like"" approach for
addressing dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.

(T2DM) prognosis. This multicenter study aimed to investigate blood glucose
control among patients with insulin-treated T2DM in North China and explore the
application value of combining an elastic network (EN) with a machine-learning
algorithm to predict glycemic control.
METHODS: Basic information, biochemical indices, and diabetes-related data were
collected via questionnaire from 2787 consecutive participants recruited from 27 
centers in six cities between January 2016 and December 2017. An EN regression
was used to address variable collinearity. Then, three common machine learning
algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and back
propagation artificial neural network [BP-ANN]) were used to simulate and predict
blood glucose status. Additionally, a stepwise logistic regression was performed 
to compare the machine learning models.
RESULTS: The well-controlled blood glucose rate was 45.82% in North China. The
multivariable analysis found that hypertension history, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease history, exercise, and total cholesterol were protective
factors in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control, while central adiposity,
family history, T2DM duration, complications, insulin dose, blood pressure, and
hypertension were risk factors for elevated HbA1c. Before the dimensional
reduction in the EN, the areas under the curve of RF, SVM, and BP were 0.73,
0.61, and 0.70, respectively, while these figures increased to 0.75, 0.72, and
0.72, respectively, after dimensional reduction. Moreover, the EN and machine
learning models had higher sensitivity and accuracy than the logistic regression 
models (the sensitivity and accuracy of logistic were 0.52 and 0.56; RF: 0.79,
0.70; SVM: 0.84, 0.73; BP-ANN: 0.78, 0.73, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of T2DM patients in North China had poor glycemic
control and were at a higher risk of developing diabetic complications. The EN
and machine learning algorithms are alternative choices, in addition to the
traditional logistic model, for building predictive models of blood glucose
control in patients with T2DM.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31880745.pdf

using data-driven methodologies. However, patterns of severe exacerbations have
not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate longitudinal trajectories of severe wheeze
exacerbations from infancy to school-age.
METHODS: We applied longitudinal k-means clustering to derive exacerbation
trajectories among 887 participants from a population-based birth cohort with
severe wheeze exacerbations confirmed in healthcare records. We examined
early-life risk factors of the derived trajectories, and their asthma-related
outcomes and lung function in adolescence.
RESULTS: 498/887 children (56%) had physician-confirmed wheeze by age 8 years, of
whom 160 had at least one severe exacerbation. A two-cluster model provided the
optimal solution for severe exacerbation trajectories among these 160 children:
""Infrequent exacerbations (IE)"" (n=150, 93.7%) and ""Early-onset frequent
exacerbations (FE)"" (n=10, 6.3%). Shorter duration of breastfeeding was the
strongest early-life risk factor for FE (weeks, median [IQR]: FE, 0 [0-1.75] vs. 
IE, 6 [0-20], p<0.001). Specific airway resistance (sRaw ) was significantly
higher in FE compared to IE trajectory throughout childhood. We then compared
children in the two exacerbation trajectories with those who have never wheezed
(NW, n=389), or have wheezed but had no severe exacerbations (WNE, n=338). At age
8 years, FEV1 /FVC was significantly lower and FeNO significantly higher among FE
children compared to all other groups. By adolescence (age 16), subjects in FE
trajectory were significantly more likely to have current asthma (67% FE vs. 30% 
IE vs. 13% WNE, p<0.001) and use inhaled corticosteroids (77% FE vs. 15% IE vs.
18% WNE, p<0.001). Lung function was significantly diminished in the FE
trajectory (FEV1 /FVC, mean [95%CI]: 89.9% [89.3-90.5] vs. 88.1% [87.3-88.8] vs. 
85.1% [83.4-86.7] vs. 74.7% [61.5-87.8], NW, WNE, IE, FE respectively, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: We have identified two distinct trajectories of severe exacerbations 
during childhood with different early-life risk factors and asthma-related
outcomes in adolescence.

methylation modified at 2'-hydroxy, which is common in mRNAs and various
non-coding RNAs. Previous studies revealed the significance of Nm in multiple
biological processes. With Nm getting more and more attention, a revolutionary
technique termed Nm-seq, was developed to profile Nm sites mainly in mRNA with
single nucleotide resolution and high sensitivity. In a recent work, supported by
the Nm-seq data, we have reported a method in silico for predicting Nm sites,
which relies on nucleotide sequence information, and established an online server
named NmSEER. More recently, a more confident dataset produced by refined Nm-seq 
was available. Therefore, in this work, we redesigned the prediction model to
achieve a more robust performance on the new data.
RESULTS: We redesigned the prediction model from two perspectives, including
machine learning algorithm and multi-encoding scheme combination. With
optimization by 5-fold cross-validation tests and evaluation by independent test 
respectively, random forest was selected as the most robust algorithm. Meanwhile,
one-hot encoding, together with position-specific dinucleotide sequence profile
and K-nucleotide frequency encoding were collectively applied to build the final 
predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictor of updated version, named NmSEER V2.0, achieves an
accurate prediction performance (AUROC = 0.862) and has been settled into a
brand-new server, which is available at http://www.rnanut.net/nmseer-v2/ for

point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. We compared 6 popular DL
architectures for POCUS cardiac image classification to determine whether an
optimal DL architecture exists for future DL algorithm development in POCUS.
METHODS: We trained 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a range of
complexities and ages (AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, and
Inception-v4). Each CNN was trained by using images of 5 typical POCUS cardiac
views. Images were extracted from 225 publicly available deidentified POCUS
cardiac videos. A total of 750,018 individual images were extracted, with 90%
used for model training and 10% for cross-validation. The training time and
accuracy achieved were tracked. A real-world test of the algorithms was performed
on a set of 125 completely new cardiac images. Descriptive statistics, Pearson R 
values, and κ values were calculated for each CNN.
RESULTS: Accuracy ranged from 96% to 85.6% correct for the 6 CNNs. VGG-16, one of
the oldest and simplest CNNs, performed best at 96% correct with 232 minutes to
train (R = 0.97; κ = 0.95; P < .00001). The worst-performing CNN was the newer
DenseNet201, with 85.6% accuracy and 429 minutes to train (R = 0.92; κ = 0.82;
P < .00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Six common image classification DL algorithms showed considerable
variability in their accuracy and training time when trained and tested on
identical data, suggesting that not all will perform optimally for POCUS DL
applications. Contrary to well-established accuracies for CNNs, more modern and
deeper algorithms yielded poorer results.

signs of preterm infants in the hospital presents several challenges, such as the
detection of the presence or the absence of a patient in the video frame,
robustness to changes in lighting conditions, automated identification of
suitable time periods and regions of interest from which vital signs can be
estimated. We carried out a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and the
proportion of time that heart rate and respiratory rate can be estimated from
preterm infants using only a video camera in a clinical environment, without
interfering with regular patient care. A total of 426.6 h of video and reference 
vital signs were recorded for 90 sessions from 30 preterm infants in the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Each preterm
infant was recorded under regular ambient light during daytime for up to four
consecutive days. We developed multi-task deep learning algorithms to
automatically segment skin areas and to estimate vital signs only when the infant
was present in the field of view of the video camera and no clinical
interventions were undertaken. We propose signal quality assessment algorithms
for both heart rate and respiratory rate to discriminate between clinically
acceptable and noisy signals. The mean absolute error between the reference and
camera-derived heart rates was 2.3 beats/min for over 76% of the time for which
the reference and camera data were valid. The mean absolute error between the
reference and camera-derived respiratory rate was 3.5 breaths/min for over 82% of
the time. Accurate estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate could be derived 
for at least 90% of the time, if gaps of up to 30 seconds with no estimates were 
allowed.

experimental data, which limit further progress. In this study, we present the
design, development, calibration and independent validation of a human-based

supports the credibility of the ToR-ORd model under healthy and key disease
conditions, as well as drug blockade. In addition, the process uncovers new
theoretical insights into the biophysical properties of the L-type calcium
current, which are critical for sodium and calcium dynamics. These insights
enable the reformulation of L-type calcium current, as well as replacement of the

the media. Social media, such as Twitter, has become a valuable online tool to
describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different 
medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more
than one cell population would be adversely affected. These types of side effect 
are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed
drugs but do not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients.
This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate method to collect and
classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter.
Materials and Methods: In this classification method, we selected ""ask a patient""
dataset and combination of Twitter ""Ask a Patient"" datasets that comprised of
6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with the
word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture
by HAN, FastText, and CNN.
Results: Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more 
advanced peculiarity in learning information compared to other types of machine
learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of incorporating 
various semantic features, including topics and concepts.
Conclusion: Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the
combination of Twitter and ""Ask a Patient"" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite 
the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learningbased text
classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR.

AIMS: This study aimed to assess age- and sex-related differences in management
and 1-year risk for all-cause mortality and hospitalization in chronic heart
failure (HF) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 16 354 patients included in the European Society of
Cardiology Heart Failure Long-Term Registry, 9428 chronic HF patients were
analysed [median age: 66 years; 28.5% women; mean left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) 37%]. Rates of use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)
were high (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor
blockers, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: 85.7%, 88.7% 
and 58.8%, respectively). Crude GDMT utilization rates were lower in women than
in men (all differences: P ≤ 0.001), and GDMT use became lower with ageing in
both sexes, at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Sex was not an independent
predictor of GDMT prescription; however, age >75 years was a significant
predictor of GDMT underutilization. Rates of all-cause mortality were lower in
women than in men (7.1% vs. 8.7%; P = 0.015), as were rates of all-cause
hospitalization (21.9% vs. 27.3%; P < 0.001) and there were no differences in
causes of death. All-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization increased with
greater age in both sexes. Sex was not an independent predictor of 1-year
all-cause mortality (restricted to patients with LVEF ≤45%). Mortality risk was
significantly lower in patients of younger age, compared to patients aged
>75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a decline in GDMT use with advanced age in both sexes. Sex
was not an independent predictor of GDMT or adverse outcomes. However, age
>75 years independently predicted lower GDMT use and higher all-cause mortality
in patients with LVEF ≤45%.

in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. We hypothesized that it is possible to
accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory
signals.
METHODS: Using a dataset including 8,682 polysomnograms, we develop deep neural
networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory signals. Five deep neural
networks consisting of convolutional networks and long short-term memory networks
are trained to stage sleep using heart and breathing, including the timing of R
peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest respiratory effort, and the combinations of
these signals.
RESULTS: ECG in combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the
best performance for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.585 
(95% confidence interval +/-0.017); and 0.760 (+/-0.019) for discriminating awake
vs. rapid eye movement vs. non-rapid eye movement sleep. Performance is better
for younger ages, while it is robust for body mass index, apnea severity, and
commonly used outpatient medications.
CONCLUSION: Our results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide
substantial information about sleep stages in a large heterogeneous population.
This opens new possibilities in sleep research and applications where
electroencephalography is not readily available or may be infeasible.

diseases and could lead to autonomic nerve dysfunction, which is often seen in
neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have shown that metoprolol prevents 
several chronic OSA-induced cardiovascular diseases through inhibiting autonomic 
nerve hyperactivity. It remains unclear whether chronic OSA can lead to dendritic
remodeling in the brain, and whether metoprolol affects the dendritic remodeling.
In this study we investigated the effect of metoprolol on dendrite morphology in 
a canine model of chronic OSA, which was established in beagles through clamping 
and reopening the endotracheal tube for 4 h every other day for 12 weeks. OSA
beagles were administered metoprolol (5 mg· kg-1· d-1). The dendritic number,
length, crossings and spine density of neurons in hippocampi and prefrontal
cortices were assessed by Golgi staining. And the protein levels of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
were measured by Western blotting. We showed that chronic OSA successfully
induced significant brain hypoxia evidenced by increased HIF-1α levels in CA1
region and dentate gyrus of hippocampi, as well as in prefrontal cortex.
Furthermore, OSA led to markedly decreased dendrite number, length and
intersections, spine loss as well as reduced BDNF levels. Administration of
metoprolol effectively prevented the dendritic remodeling and spine loss induced 
by chronic OSA. In addition, administration of metoprolol reversed the decreased 
BDNF, which might be associated with the metoprolol-induced neuronal protection. 
In conclusion, metoprolol protects against neuronal dendritic remodeling in
hippocampi and prefrontal cortices induced by chronic OSA in canine.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31863057.pdf

gene expression reprogramming, which is frequently accompanied by the aberrant
regulation of RNA processing mechanisms. In brain tumors, defects in alternative 
splicing result either from the dysregulation of expression and activity of
splicing factors, or from mutations in the genes encoding splicing machinery
components. Aberrant splicing regulation can generate dysfunctional proteins that
lead to modification of fundamental physiological cellular processes, thus
contributing to the development or progression of brain tumors. Herein, we
summarize the current knowledge on splicing abnormalities in brain tumors and how
these alterations contribute to the disease by sustaining proliferative
signaling, escaping growth suppressors, or establishing a tumor microenvironment

with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors including
rivaroxaban (RIVA) compared to vitamin K antagonists. At the same time, low-dose 
RIVA has been shown to reduce mortality and atherothrombotic events in patients
with coronary artery disease (CAD). Yet, the mechanisms underlying this reduction
remain unknown. Objective: In this study we hypothesized, that RIVA's
antithrombotic potential is linked to a hitherto unknown RIVA effect that impacts
on platelet reactivity and arterial thrombosis. Methods and Results: In this
study, we identified FXa as potent, direct agonist of the protease activated
receptor-1 (PAR-1), leading to platelet activation and thrombus formation which
can be inhibited by RIVA. We found that RIVA reduced arterial thrombus stability 
in a mouse model of arterial thrombosis using intravital microscopy. For in vitro
studies, atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on permanent RIVA treatment for stroke
prevention, respective controls and patients with new onset AF prior to and after
first intake of RIVA (time-series analysis) were recruited. Platelet aggregation 
responses as well as thrombus formation under arterial flow conditions on
collagen and atherosclerotic plaque material were attenuated by RIVA. We show
that RIVA's antiplatelet effect is plasma dependent but independent of thrombin
and RIVA's anticoagulatory capacity. Conclusions: Here we identified FXa as
potent platelet agonist that acts through PAR1. Therefore, RIVA exerts an
antiplatelet effect that together with its well-known potent anticoagulatory
capacity might lead to reduced frequency of atherothrombotic events and improved 
outcome in patients.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31859592.pdf

survival of 2-3 years. Pulmonary arterial hypertension may be idiopathic (IPAH)
but is frequently associated with other conditions. Despite increased awareness, 
therapeutic advances, and improved outcomes, the time from symptom onset to
diagnosis remains unchanged. The commonest symptoms of PAH (breathlessness and
fatigue) are non-specific and clinical signs are usually subtle, frequently
preventing early diagnosis where therapies may be more effective. The failure to 
improve the time to diagnosis largely reflects an inability to identify patients 
at increased risk of PAH using current approaches. To date, strategies to improve
the time to diagnosis have focused on screening patients with a high prevalence
[systemic sclerosis (10%), patients with portal hypertension assessed for liver
transplantation (2-6%), carriers of mutations of the gene encoding bone
morphogenetic protein receptor type II, and first-degree relatives of patients
with heritable PAH]. In systemic sclerosis, screening algorithms have
demonstrated that patients can be identified earlier, however, current approaches
are resource intensive. Until, recently, it has not been considered possible to
screen populations for rare conditions such as IPAH (prevalence
5-15/million/year). However, there is interest in the use of artificial
intelligence approaches in medicine and the application of diagnostic algorithms 
to large healthcare data sets, to identify patients at risk of rare conditions.
In this article, we review current approaches and challenges in screening for PAH
and explore novel population-based approaches to improve detection.

immune defences and promote infection. In particular, bacteria use virulence
factors, such as secreted toxins and effector proteins, to manipulate host
cellular processes and establish a replicative niche. Survival of eukaryotic
organisms in the face of such challenge requires host mechanisms to detect and
counteract these pathogen-specific virulence strategies. In this Review, we focus
on effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in metazoan organisms as a mechanism for
pathogen sensing and distinguishing pathogenic from non-pathogenic
microorganisms. For the purposes of this Review, we adopt the concept of ETI
formulated originally in the context of plant pathogens and their hosts, wherein 
specific host proteins 'guard' central cellular processes and trigger
inflammatory responses following pathogen-driven disruption of these processes.
While molecular mechanisms of ETI are well-described in plants, our understanding
of functionally analogous mechanisms in metazoans is still emerging. In this
Review, we present an overview of ETI in metazoans and discuss recently described
cellular processes that are guarded by the host. Although all pathogens
manipulate host pathways, we focus primarily on bacterial pathogens and highlight
pathways of effector-triggered immune defence that sense disruption of core
cellular processes by pathogens. Finally, we discuss recent developments in our
understanding of how pathogens can evade ETI to overcome these host adaptations.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31857733.pdf

earlier detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is not available at
present. In this study, we compare different algorithms of risk prediction in
order to select the best one for constructing a biomarker-based risk score,
PancRISK.
METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with available measurements of
three urine biomarkers, (LYVE1, REG1B and TFF1) using retrospectively collected
samples, as well as creatinine and age, were randomly split into training and
validation sets, following stratification into cases (PDAC) and controls (healthy
patients). Several machine learning algorithms were used, and their performance
characteristics were compared. The latter included AUC (area under ROC curve) and
sensitivity at clinically relevant specificity.
RESULTS: None of the algorithms significantly outperformed all others. A logistic
regression model, the easiest to interpret, was incorporated into a PancRISK
score and subsequently evaluated on the whole data set. The PancRISK performance 
could be even further improved when CA19-9, commonly used PDAC biomarker, is
added to the model.

entire vasculature. Their phenotypes and physiological functions are initially
regulated by developmental signals and extracellular stimuli. The underlying
molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse phenotypes of ECs from different
organs are not well understood.
RESULTS: To characterize the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape in the
vascular system, we cataloged gene expression and active histone marks in nine
types of human ECs (generating 148 genome-wide datasets) and carried out a
comprehensive analysis with chromatin interaction data. We developed a robust
procedure for comparative epigenome analysis that circumvents variations at the
level of the individual and technical noise derived from sample preparation under
various conditions. Through this approach, we identified 3765 EC-specific
enhancers, some of which were associated with disease-associated genetic
variations. We also identified various candidate marker genes for each EC type.
We found that the nine EC types can be divided into two subgroups, corresponding 
to those with upper-body origins and lower-body origins, based on their
epigenomic landscape. Epigenomic variations were highly correlated with gene
expression patterns, but also provided unique information. Most of the
deferentially expressed genes and enhancers were cooperatively enriched in more
than one EC type, suggesting that the distinct combinations of multiple genes
play key roles in the diverse phenotypes across EC types. Notably, many homeobox 
genes were differentially expressed across EC types, and their expression was
correlated with the relative position of each organ in the body. This reflects
the developmental origins of ECs and their roles in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis 
and wound healing.

types reveals diverse transcriptional regulation across human vascular systems.

such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and focused
ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) biomedical scientists can study
sub-cellular structural mechanisms of heart disease at high resolution and high
volume. Among several key components that determine healthy contractile function 
in cardiomyocytes are Z-disks or Z-lines, which are located at the lateral
borders of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of striated muscle. Z-disks play
the important role of anchoring contractile proteins within the cell that make
the heartbeat. Changes to their organization can affect the force with which the 
cardiomyocyte contracts and may also affect signaling pathways that regulate
cardiomyocyte health and function. Compared to other components in the cell, such
as mitochondria, Z-disks appear as very thin linear structures in microscopy data
with limited difference in contrast to the remaining components of the cell.
METHODS: In this paper, we propose to generate a 3D model of Z-disks within
single adult cardiac cells from an automated segmentation of a large
serial-block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) dataset. The proposed
fully automated segmentation scheme is comprised of three main modules including 
""pre-processing"", ""segmentation"" and ""refinement"". We represent a simple, yet
effective model to perform segmentation and refinement steps. Contrast
stretching, and Gaussian kernels are used to pre-process the dataset, and
well-known ""Sobel operators"" are used in the segmentation module.
RESULTS: We have validated our model by comparing segmentation results with
ground-truth annotated Z-disks in terms of pixel-wise accuracy. The results show 
that our model correctly detects Z-disks with 90.56% accuracy. We also compare
and contrast the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in segmenting a FIB-SEM
dataset against the accuracy of segmentations from a machine learning program
called Ilastik and discuss the advantages and disadvantages that these two
approaches have.

our algorithm and model both in terms of validation metrics and in terms of a

cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated the incidence of cardiovascular disease

which were sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
(DPP-4is).Materials and methods: We compared the risk of myocardial infarction
(MI) among these drugs and developed a machine learning model for predicting MI
in patients without prior heart disease. We analyzed US health plan data for
patients without prior MI or insulin therapy who were aged ≥40 years at initial
prescription and had not received oral antidiabetic drugs for ≥6 months
previously. After developing a machine learning model to predict MI, proportional
hazards analysis of MI incidence was conducted using the risk obtained with this 
model and the drug classes as explanatory variables.Results: We analyzed 199,116 
patients (mean age: years), comprising 110,278 (58.6) prescribed DPP-4is, 43,538 
(55.1) prescribed GLP-1RAs and 45,300 (55.3) prescribed SGLT-2is. Receiver
operating characteristics analysis showed higher precision of machine learning
over logistic regression analysis. Proportional hazards analysis by machine
learning revealed a significantly lower risk of MI with SGLT-2is or GLP-1RAs than
DPP-4is (hazard ratio: 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.91, p = .0004 vs.
0.63, 0.56-0.72, p < .0001). MI risk was also significantly lower with GLP-1RAs
than SGLT-2is (0.77, 0.66-0.90, p = .001).Limitations: All patients analyzed were
covered by US commercial health plans, so information on patients aged ≥65 years 
was limited and the socioeconomic background may have been biased. Also, the
observation period differed among the three classes of drugs due to differing
release dates.Conclusions: Machine learning analysis suggested the risk of MI was

disease in diabetic patients. Here, we investigated the effect of pretreatment
with vildagliptin on myocardial arrhythmias, inflammatory responses, and
expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis following cardiac
ischemic injury in type II diabetic male Wistar rats.
METHODS: Chronic diabetes was modeled by a high-fat diet and low-dose
streptozotocin method and lasted for 12 weeks. Vildagliptin (6 mg/dl) was orally 
administered during the last 4 weeks of the diabetic period. Then, rats' hearts
(n = 8/each group) were immediately isolated and transferred to the Langendorff
apparatus, in which left anterior descending coronary artery was tightened for
35 min to induce regional ischemia. Electrocardiography was continuously recorded
and myocardial arrhythmias were interpreted according to the Lambeth Convention. 
Inflammatory cytokines in left ventricular samples were measured using ELISA
kits, and gene expression was assayed using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Diabetic groups showed increased incidence and duration of ventricular
fibrillation (VF) than controls (P < 0.05). Pretreatment of diabetic rats with

disease. As an important basis for diagnosing heart disease and evaluating heart 
function, the electrocardiogram (ECG) records cardiac physiological electrical
activity. Abnormalities in cardiac physiological activity are directly reflected

Considering the complexity of arrhythmia detection, we present an improved
convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Compared
with the traditional machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature
extraction steps due to the automatic feature processing layers. In this paper,
an improved CNN is proposed to automatically classify the heartbeat of
arrhythmia. Firstly, all the heartbeats are divided from the original signals.
After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be inputted into the first
convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels with different sizes are
used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage of the features in
different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed. The outputs of the last
pooling layer are merged and as the input to fully-connected layers. Our
experiment is in accordance with the AAMI inter-patient standard, which included 
normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats
(V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). For verification, the MIT
arrhythmia database is introduced to confirm the accuracy of the proposed method,
then, comparative experiments are conducted. The experiment demonstrates that our
proposed method has high performance for arrhythmia detection, the accuracy is
99.06%. When properly trained, the proposed improved CNN model can be employed as
a tool to automatically detect different kinds of arrhythmia from ECG.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31853698.pdf

integrating clinical parameters with coronary artery calcium (CAC), and automated
epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) quantification, for the prediction of long-term
risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac death in asymptomatic subjects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study included 1912 asymptomatic subjects [1117 (58.4%) 
male, age: 55.8 ± 9.1 years] from the prospective EISNER trial with long-term
follow-up after CAC scoring. EAT volume and density were quantified using a fully
automated deep learning method. ML extreme gradient boosting was trained using
clinical co-variates, plasma lipid panel measurements, risk factors, CAC, aortic 
calcium, and automated EAT measures, and validated using repeated 10-fold cross
validation. During mean follow-up of 14.5 ± 2 years, 76 events of MI and/or
cardiac death occurred. ML obtained a significantly higher AUC than
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and CAC score for predicting 
events (ML: 0.82; ASCVD: 0.77; CAC: 0.77, P < 0.05 for all). Subjects with a
higher ML score (by Youden's index) had high hazard of suffering events (HR:
10.38, P < 0.001); the relationships persisted in multivariable analysis
including ASCVD-risk and CAC measures (HR: 2.94, P = 0.005). Age, ASCVD-risk, and
CAC were prognostically important for both genders. Systolic blood pressure was
more important than cholesterol in women, and the opposite in men.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, machine learning used to integrate
clinical and quantitative imaging-based variables significantly improves
prediction of MI and cardiac death compared with standard clinical risk
assessment. Following further validation, such a personalized paradigm could
potentially be used to improve cardiovascular risk assessment.

monitor physiological processes and disease. However, the use of this technique
to image internal organs, such as the heart, has not yet been investigated. We
sought to determine the ability of our novel thermal image-processing algorithm
to detect structural and functional changes in a mouse model of hypertension and 
cardiac remodeling. Twelve mice were randomly assigned to receive either the
pro-inflammatory, hypertensive hormone angiotensin-II (2 mg/kg/day, n = 6) or
saline (n = 6) infusion for 28 days. We performed weekly blood pressure
measurements, together with serial trans-thoracic echocardiography studies and
histopathological evaluation of the hearts. Thermal images were captured with a
commercially available thermal camera, and images were processed by our novel
algorithm which analyzes relative spatial temperature variation across the
animal's thorax. We assessed cardiac inflammation by measuring inflammatory cell 
infiltration through flow cytometry. Angiotensin infusion increased blood
pressure together with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Thermal imaging at day
28 of the experiment detected an increase in the fraction of the skin heated by
the heart in angiotensin-treated mice. Thermal image findings were significantly 
correlated to left ventricular volume and mass parameters seen on
echocardiography (r = 0.8, p < 0.01 and r = 0.6, p = 0.07). We also identified
distinct changes in the spatial heat profiles of all angiotensin-treated hearts, 
possibly reflecting remodeling processes in the hypertensive heart. Finally, a
machine learning based model using thermal imaging parameters predicted
intervention status in 10 out of 11 mice similar to a model using
echocardiographic measurements. Our findings suggest, for the first time, that a 
new thermal image-processing algorithm successfully correlates surface
thermography with cardiac structural changes in mice with hypertensive heart
disease.

with severe sepsis or septic shock and this is associated with worse outcomes.
Despite markedly altered and rapidly changing pharmacokinetics in these patients,
guidelines and clinicians continue to rely on standard dosing schemes. To address
this challenge, we developed AutoKinetics, a clinical decision support system for
antibiotic dosing. By feeding large amounts of electronic health record patient
data into pharmacokinetic models, patient-specific predicted future plasma
concentrations are displayed graphically. In addition, a tailored dosing advice
is provided at the bedside in real time. To evaluate the effect of AutoKinetics
on pharmacometric and clinical endpoints, we are conducting the Right Dose Right 
Now multicenter, randomized controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, non-blinded,
superiority trial.
METHODS: All adult intensive care patients with a suspected or proven infection
and having either lactatemia or receiving vasopressor support are eligible for
inclusion. Randomization to the AutoKinetics or control group is initiated at the
bedside when prescribing at least one of four commonly administered antibiotics: 
ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, meropenem and vancomycin. Dosing advice is available 
for patients in the AutoKinetics group, whereas patients in the control group
receive standard dosing. The primary outcome of the study is pharmacometric
target attainment during the first 24 h. Power analysis revealed the need for
inclusion of 42 patients per group per antibiotic. Thus, a total of 336 patients 
will be included, 168 in each group. Secondary pharmacometric endpoints include
time to target attainment and fraction of target attainment during an entire
antibiotic course. Secondary clinical endpoints include mortality, clinical cure 
and days free from organ support. Several other exploratory and subgroup analyses
are planned.
DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the
effectiveness and safety of bedside data-driven automated antibiotic dosing
advice. This is important as adequate antibiotic exposure may be crucial to treat
severe sepsis and septic shock. In addition, the trial could prove to be a
significant contribution to clinical pharmacometrics and serve as a stepping
stone for the use of big data and artificial intelligence in the field.

Whereas several definitions for IDH are available, a nadir systolic blood
pressure carries the strongest relation with outcome. Whereas the relation
between IDH may partly be based on patient characteristics, it is likely that
also impaired organ perfusion leading to permanent damage, plays a role in this
relationship. The pathogenesis of IDH is multifactorial and is based on a
combination of a decline in blood volume (BV) and impaired vascular resistance at
a background of a reduced cardiovascular reserve. Measurements of absolute BV
based on an on-line dilution method appear more promising than relative BV
measurements in the prediction of IDH. Also, feedback treatments in which
ultrafiltration rate is automatically adjusted based on changes in relative BV
have not yet resulted in improvement. Frequent assessment of dry weight,
attempting to reduce interdialytic weight gain and prescribing more frequent or
longer dialysis treatments may aid in preventing IDH. The impaired vascular
response can be improved using isothermic or cool dialysis treatment which has
also been associated with a reduction in end organ damage, although their effect 
on mortality has not yet been assessed. For the future, identification of
vulnerable patients based on artificial intelligence and on-line assessment of
markers of organ perfusion may aid in individualizing treatment prescription,
which will always remain dependent on the clinical context of the patient.

encoding coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Current treatments are based on regular
infusions of FVIII concentrates throughout a patient's life. Alternatively, viral
gene therapies that directly deliver F8 in vivo have shown preliminary successes.
However, hurdles remain, including lack of infection specificity and the
inability to deliver the full-length version of F8 due to restricted viral cargo 
sizes. Here, we developed an alternative nonviral ex vivo gene-therapy approach
that enables the overexpression of full-length F8 in patients' endothelial cells 
(ECs). We first generated HA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells
(HA-iPSCs) from urine epithelial cells and genetically modified them using a
piggyBac DNA transposon system to insert multiple copies of full-length F8. We
subsequently differentiated the modified HA-iPSCs into competent ECs with high
efficiency, and demonstrated that the cells (termed HA-FLF8-iECs) were capable of
producing high levels of FVIII. Importantly, following subcutaneous implantation 
into immunodeficient hemophilic (SCID-f8ko) mice, we demonstrated that
HA-FLF8-iECs were able to self-assemble into vascular networks, and that the
newly formed microvessels had the capacity to deliver functional FVIII directly
into the bloodstream of the mice, effectively correcting the clotting deficiency.
Moreover, our implant maintains cellular confinement, which reduces potential
safety concerns and allows effective monitoring and reversibility. We envision
that this proof-of-concept study could become the basis for a novel autologous ex
vivo gene-therapy approach to treat HA.

between dispensing evidence-based medications (EBMs) at discharge and outcomes,
we extracted published studies in English from PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE from
2007 to early 2019. The EBMs included renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
(RASIs), β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). The main 
outcomes of interest were all-cause death and heart failure (HF) readmission.
Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random effect model from the
adjusted HRs or relative risks (RRs) extracted from individual studies,
stratified by HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). Forty-three studies including a total number of
295,060 patients with an average follow-up time of 2.3 years were identified for 
systematic review. Dispensing RASI at discharge was independently associated with
30% and 25% lower risks of all-cause death and HF readmission respectively in
HFrEF but has a moderate effect on reducing all-cause deaths (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 
0.81-0.95) in HFpEF. By contrast, dispensing β-blockers at discharge was
associated with 35% lower risk of all-cause deaths in HFrEF and has a weak
association with borderline statistical significance on improving overall
survival in HFpEF. Dispensing MRA at discharge was associated with 5% lower risk 
of all-cause death in HFrEF. This meta-analysis provides evidence to support

multiple electrode channels affects the evoked sensations should help in
improving the definition of encoding strategies for bidirectional prostheses. We 
characterized the sensations evoked by simultaneous stimulation of median and
ulnar nerves (multi-channel configuration) in four transradial amputees who had
been implanted with four TIMEs (Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel
Electrodes). The results were compared with the characterization of
single-channel stimulation. The sensations were characterized in terms of
location, extent, type, and intensity. Combining two or more single-channel
configurations caused a linear combination of the sensation locations and types
perceived with such single-channel stimulations. Interestingly, this was also
true when two active sites from the same nerve were stimulated. When stimulating 
in multi-channel configuration, the charge needed from each electrode channel to 
evoke a sensation was significantly lower than the one needed in single-channel
configuration (sensory facilitation). This result was also supported by
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during nerve stimulation. Somatosensory
potentials evoked by multi-channel stimulation confirmed that sensations in the
amputated hand were perceived by the subjects and that a perceptual sensory

    Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2020 Jan 7;15(1):2-4.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: How to best medically manage patients who survived
hospitalized AKI is unclear. Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers in this
setting may increase risk of recurrent AKI.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a cohort study of 10,242
members of an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California who
experienced AKI and survived a hospitalization between January 1, 2006 and
December 31, 2013. All study participants did not have prior heart failure or use
of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) up to 5 years prior. New receipt and time-updated exposure of
ACE-Is/ARBs was identified on the basis of dispensed prescriptions found in
outpatient health plan pharmacy databases. The main outcome of interest was
subsequent episode of hospitalized AKI after discharge from an initial index
hospitalization complicated by AKI. Recurrent AKI episode was defined using acute
changes in serum creatinine concentrations. Marginal structural models were used 
to adjust for baseline and potential time-dependent confounders.
RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of the study population had a documented eGFR<60
ml/min per 1.73 m2 or documented proteinuria before hospitalization. With a
median of 3 (interquartile range, 1-5) years of follow-up, 1853 (18%) patients
initiated use of ACE-Is/ARBs and 2124 (21%) patients experienced recurrent AKI.
Crude rate of recurrent AKI was 6.1 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.9 to
6.4) per 100 person-years off ACE-Is/ARBs and 5.7 (95% CI, 4.9 to 6.5) per 100
person-years on ACE-Is/ARBs. In marginal structural causal inference models that 
adjusted for baseline and potential time-dependent confounders, exposure to
ACE-I/ARB use was not associated with higher incidence of recurrent AKI (adjusted
odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.12).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of AKI survivors without heart failure, new use of
ACE-I/ARB therapy was not independently associated with increased risk of
recurrent hospitalized AKI.

disease that is classified into stages based on disease severity. We aimed to
characterize the time to progression prior to death in patients with COPD and to

different stages of COPD progression.
METHODS: We present a two-step approach for visualizing COPD progression at the
level of unstructured clinical notes. We included 15,500 COPD patients who both
received care within Partners Healthcare's network and died between 2011 and
2017. We first propose a four-layer deep learning model that utilizes a specially
configured recurrent neural network to capture irregular time lapse segments.
Using those irregular time lapse segments, we created a temporal visualization
(the COPD atlas) to demonstrate COPD progression, which consisted of
representative sentences at each time window prior to death based on a fraction
of theme words produced by a latent Dirichlet allocation model. We evaluated our 
approach on an annotated corpus of COPD patients' unstructured pulmonary,
radiology, and cardiology notes.
RESULTS: Experiments compared to the baselines showed that our proposed approach 
improved interpretability as well as the accuracy of estimating COPD progression.

efflux and decreased inflammatory gene expression. These EC-targeted gene-therapy
strategies might be improved by concurrent upregulation of cholesterol-efflux
pathways in other intimal cell types. Here we report modification of this
strategy to enable delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to cells of the
sub-endothelium. We constructed an HDAd (HDAdXMoAntimiR33a5p) that expresses an
antagomiR directed at miR-33a-5p (a microRNA that suppresses cholesterol efflux
by silencing ABCA1). HDAdXMoAntimiR33a5p contains a sequence motif that enhances 
uptake of anti-miR-33a-5p into exosomes. Cultured EC release exosomes containing 
small RNA, including miR-33a-5p. After transduction with HDAdXMoAntimiR33a5p,
EC-derived exosomes containing anti-miR-33a-5p accumulate in conditioned media
(CM). When this CM is added to macrophages or SMC, anti-miR-33a-5p is detected in
these target cells. Exosome-mediated transfer of anti-miR-33a-5p reduces
miR-33a-5p by ~65-80%, increases ABCA1 protein by 1.6-2.2-fold, and increases
apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux by 1.4-1.6-fold (all p ≤ 0.01). These effects
were absent in macrophages and SMC incubated in exosome-depleted CM. EC
transduced with HDAdXMoAntimiR33a5p release exosomes that can transfer
anti-miR-33a-5p to other intimal cell types, upregulating cholesterol efflux from
these cells. This strategy provides a platform for genetic modification of
intimal and medial cells, using a vector that transduces only EC.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31842627.pdf

Uncertainty of labels in clinical data resulting from intra-observer variability 
can have direct impact on the reliability of assessments made by deep neural
networks. In this paper, we propose a method for modelling such uncertainty in
the context of 2D echocardiography (echo), which is a routine procedure for
detecting cardiovascular disease at point-of-care. Echo imaging quality and
acquisition time is highly dependent on the operator's experience level. Recent
developments have shown the possibility of automating echo image quality
quantification by mapping an expert's assessment of quality to the echo image via
deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the observer variability in the expert's 
assessment can impact the quality quantification accuracy. Here, we aim to model 
the intra-observer variability in echo quality assessment as an aleatoric
uncertainty modelling regression problem with the introduction of a novel method 
that handles the regression problem with categorical labels. A key feature of our
design is that only a single forward pass is sufficient to estimate the level of 
uncertainty for the network output. Compared to the 0.11±0.09 absolute error (in 
a scale from 0 to 1) archived by the conventional regression method, the proposed
method brings the error down to 0.09±0.08, where the improvement is statistically
significant and equivalents to 5.7% test accuracy improvement. The simplicity of 
the proposed approach means that it could be generalized to other applications of
deep learning in medical imaging, where there is often uncertainty in clinical
labels.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31841401.pdf

linear combinations of current and past observations can be used to accurately
predict future observations. For instance, each element of an observation vector 
could correspond to a different node in a network, and the parameters of an
autoregressive model would correspond to the impact of the network structure on
the time series evolution. Often these models are used successfully in practice
to learn the structure of social, epidemiological, financial, or biological
neural networks. However, little is known about statistical guarantees on
estimates of such models in non-Gaussian settings. This paper addresses the
inference of the autoregressive parameters and associated network structure
within a generalized linear model framework that includes Poisson and Bernoulli
autoregressive processes. At the heart of this analysis is a sparsity-regularized
maximum likelihood estimator. While sparsity-regularization is well-studied in
the statistics and machine learning communities, those analysis methods cannot be
applied to autoregressive generalized linear models because of the correlations
and potential heteroscedasticity inherent in the observations. Sample complexity 
bounds are derived using a combination of martingale concentration inequalities
and modern empirical process techniques for dependent random variables. These
bounds, which are supported by several simulation studies, characterize the
impact of various network parameters on estimator performance.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31839683.pdf

obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) after coronary artery calcium scoring
(CACS) test.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: As an initial step we analyzed a group of 435 patients
(23% male, mean age 61 ± 10) with low to moderate probability of CAD, who
underwent clinically indicated CACS and coronary computed tomography angiography.
Based on those data we elaborated a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model for
prediction of obstructive CAD. Later the model was evaluated on a control group
of 126 consecutive patients (31% male, mean age 59 ± 10).
RESULTS: Stratified 10-fold cross-validation performed on the group of 435
patients demonstrated the GBM model's sensitivity at 100 ± 0% and specificity at 
69.8 ± 3.6%, while the outcomes (confusion matrix) of a clinical application on
the group of 126 patients were: 73 true negative, 0 false negative, 20 true
positive, and 33 false positive.
CONCLUSION: The GBM algorithm showcased a considerably high discriminatory power 
for excluding the presence of obstructive CAD, with negative predictive value and
positive predictive value of 100% and 38%, respectively.

accurate and reproducible measurements of left ventricular (LV) volumes, these
measurements are usually not performed throughout the cardiac cycle because of
lack of tools that would allow such analysis within a reasonable timeframe. A
fully-automated machine-learning (ML) algorithm was recently developed to
automatically generate LV volume-time curves. Our aim was to validate ejection
and filling parameters calculated from these curves using conventional analysis
as a reference.
METHODS: We studied 21 patients undergoing clinical CMR examinations. LV
volume-time curves were obtained using the ML-based algorithm (Neosoft), and
independently using slice-by-slice, frame-by-frame manual tracing of the
endocardial boundaries. Ejection and filling parameters derived from these curves
were compared between the two techniques. For each parameter, Bland-Altman bias
and limits of agreement (LOA) were expressed in percent of the mean measured
value.
RESULTS: Time-volume curves were generated using the automated ML analysis within
2.5 ± 0.5 min, considerably faster than the manual analysis (43 ± 14 min per
patient, including ~10 slices with 25-32 frames per slice). Time-volume curves
were similar between the two techniques in magnitude and shape. Size and function
parameters extracted from these curves showed no significant inter-technique
differences, reflected by high correlations, small biases (<10%) and mostly
reasonably narrow LOA.
CONCLUSION: ML software for dynamic LV volume measurement allows fast and
accurate, fully automated analysis of ejection and filling parameters, compared
to manual tracing based analysis. The ability to quickly evaluate time-volume
curves is important for a more comprehensive evaluation of the patient's cardiac 
function.

observed in magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the elderly. Detection and
quantification of WMHs is important to help doctors make diagnoses and evaluate
prognosis of their elderly patients, and once quantified, these can act as
biomarkers in clinical research studies. Manual delineation of WMHs can be both
time-consuming and inconsistent, hence, automatic segmentation methods are often 
preferred. However, fully automatic methods can be challenging to construct due
to the variability in lesion load, placement of lesions, and voxel intensities.
Several state-of-the-art lesion segmentation methods based on supervised
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed. These approaches require
manually delineated lesions for training the parameters of the network. Here we
present a novel approach for WMH segmentation using a CNN trained in an
unsupervised manner, by reconstructing multiple MRI sequences as weighted sums of
segmentations of WMHs and tissues present in the images. After training, our
method can be used to segment new images that are not part of the training set to
provide fast and robust segmentation of WMHs in a matter of seconds per subject. 
Comparisons with state-of-the-art WMH segmentation methods evaluated on ground
truth manual labels from two distinct data sets and six different scanners
indicate that the proposed method works well at generating accurate WMH
segmentations without the need for manual delineations.

three times weekly and might be unable to visit a dentist. In addition, dentists 
might hesitate to provide oral care because such patients tend to bleed because
they are medicated with anticoagulants, are susceptible to bacterial infections, 
and might have unusual drug reactions. We postulated that patients on
hemodialysis have worse oral status than healthy people, which in turn might
predispose such patients to systemic complications.
METHODS: We compared the status of dental caries and periodontal diseases among
80 patients on hemodialysis and 76 healthy individuals (controls) using the
decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index, total number of C4 teeth
(destruction of the entire tooth crown), and periodontal pocket depth. Clinical
data were analyzed after all patients on hemodialysis and controls provided
written, informed consent to participate in the study.
RESULTS: Total number of C4 teeth (p = 0.021), missing teeth (MT) index (p =

more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV. Yet, smoking rates are more than
twice as high among PLWH than the general population, contributing not just to
mortality but to other adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits
(neuroHIV). There is growing evidence that synergy with chronic inflammation and 
immune dysregulation that persists despite ART may be one mechanism by which
tobacco smoking contributes to neuroHIV. This review will summarize the
differential effects of nicotine vs tobacco smoking on inflammation in addition
to the effects of tobacco smoke components on HIV disease progression. We will
also discuss biomarkers of inflammation via neuroimaging as well as biomarkers of
nicotine dependence (e.g., nicotine metabolite ratio). Tobacco smoking and
nicotine may impact ART drug metabolism and conversely, certain ARTs may impact
nicotine metabolism. Thus, we will review these bidirectional relationships and
how they may contribute to neuroHIV and other adverse outcomes. We will also
discuss the effects of tobacco use on the interaction between peripheral organs
(lungs, heart, kidney) and subsequent CNS function in the context of HIV. Lastly,
given the dramatic rise in the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, we
will discuss the implications of vaping on these processes. Despite the growing
recognition of the importance of addressing tobacco use among PLWH, more research
is necessary at both the preclinical and clinical level to disentangle the
potentially synergistic effects of tobacco use, nicotine, HIV, cognition and
immune dysregulation, as well as identify optimal approaches to reduce tobacco
use. Graphical Abstract Proposed model of the relationships among HIV, ART,
smoking, inflammation, and neurocognition. Solid lines represent relationships
supported by evidence. Dashed lines represent relationships for which there is
not enough evidence to make a conclusion. (a) HIV infection produces elevated
levels of inflammation even among virally suppressed individuals. (b) HIV is
associated with deficits in cognition function. (c) Smoking rates are higher
among PLWH, compared to the general population. (d) The nicotine metabolite ratio
(NMR) is associated with smoking behavior. (e) HIV and tobacco use are both
associated with higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression,
and elevated levels of chronic stress. These factors may represent other
mechanisms linking HIV and tobacco use. (f) The relationship between nicotine,
tobacco smoking, and inflammation is complex, but it is well-established that
smoking induces inflammation; the evidence for nicotine as anti-inflammatory is
supported in some studies, but not others. (g) The relationship between tobacco
use and neurocognition may differ for the effects of nicotine (acute nicotine use
may have beneficial effects) vs. tobacco smoking (chronic use may impair
cognition). (h) Elevated levels of inflammation may be associated with deficits
in cognition. (i) PLWH may metabolize nicotine faster than those without HIV; the
mechanism is not yet known and the finding needs validation in larger samples. We
also hypothesize that if HIV-infection increases nicotine metabolism, then we
should observe an attenuation effect once ART is initiated. (j) It is possible
that the increase in NMR is due to ART effects on CYP2A6. (k) We hypothesize that

wide variety of commercial products and are increasingly being used to collect
and process raw physiological parameters into salient digital health information.
The data collected by wearables are currently being investigated across a broad
set of clinical domains and patient populations. There is significant research
occurring in the domain of algorithm development, with the aim of translating raw
sensor data into fitness- or health-related outcomes of interest for users,
patients, and health care providers.
Objectives: The aim of this review is to highlight a selected group of fitness-
and health-related indicators from wearables data and to describe several
algorithmic approaches used to generate these higher order indicators.
Methods: A systematic search of the Pubmed database was performed with the
following search terms (number of records in parentheses): Fitbit algorithm (18),
Apple Watch algorithm (3), Garmin algorithm (5), Microsoft Band algorithm (8),
Samsung Gear algorithm (2), Xiaomi MiBand algorithm (1), Huawei Band (Watch)
algorithm (2), photoplethysmography algorithm (465), accelerometry algorithm
(966), ECG algorithm (8287), continuous glucose monitor algorithm (343). The
search terms chosen for this review are focused on algorithms for wearable
devices that dominated the commercial wearables market between 2014-2017 and that
were highly represented in the biomedical literature. A second set of search
terms included categories of algorithms for fitness-related and health-related
indicators that are commonly used in wearable devices (e.g. accelerometry, PPG,
ECG). These papers covered the following domain areas: fitness; exercise;
movement; physical activity; step count; walking; running; swimming; energy
expenditure; atrial fibrillation; arrhythmia; cardiovascular; autonomic nervous
system; neuropathy; heart rate variability; fall detection; trauma; behavior
change; diet; eating; stress detection; serum glucose monitoring; continuous
glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus type 1; diabetes mellitus type 2. All
studies uncovered through this search on commercially available device algorithms
and pivotal studies on sensor algorithm development were summarized, and a
summary table was constructed using references generated by the literature review
as described (Table 1).
Conclusions: Wearable health technologies aim to collect and process raw
physiological or environmental parameters into salient digital health
information. Much of the current and future utility of wearables lies in the
signal processing steps and algorithms used to analyze large volumes of data.
Continued algorithmic development and advances in machine learning techniques
will further increase analytic capabilities. In the context of these advances,

mortality and complication rates. The diagnosis impacts not only the prognosis
but also the management of the disease. The aim of this article is to show the
findings obtained from the implementation of our most important diagnostic tools 
and discuss our standard diagnostic process for patients with IE who underwent
surgical treatment between 1994 and 2017.
Methods: Between December 1994 and January 2017 a total of 2,458 patients with IE
underwent surgery at our institution. We analyzed clinical, microbiological,
echocardiographic, and multi slice computer tomographic (MSCT) features in this
group.
Results: The most often isolated involved valve was the aortic valve (59%).
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was present in almost one third of all cases.
The most common valve failures were mitral valve insufficiency (MI) and aortic
valve insufficiency (AI) (65% and 57% respectively). Almost one half of the
aortic insufficiencies were severe. 63% of all vegetations assessed by
echocardiography were larger than 1 cm. We detected a septic embolism in 44% of
patients and the most common target organ was the spleen (25%). The most common
isolated pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (26%) and affected patients had a
significant correlation with in-hospital mortality (P=0.004).
Conclusions: Echocardiography offers valuable information and is the most
important diagnostic method in patients with IE. Preoperative MSCT contributes to
the entire perioperative decision-making process. Microbiological diagnosis is
mandatory in choosing and adjusting antibiotic therapy and also has prognostic
value.

3D Transesophageal Echocardiography is an excellent tool for evaluating the
mitral valve and is also well suited for guiding cardiac interventions. We
introduce a fully automatic method for mitral annulus segmentation in 3D
Transesophageal Echocardiography, which requires no manual input. One hundred
eleven multi-frame 3D transesophageal echocardiography recordings were split into
training, validation, and test sets. Each 3D recording was decomposed into a set 
of 2D planes, exploiting the symmetry around the centerline of the left
ventricle. A deep 2D convolutional neural network was trained to predict the
mitral annulus coordinates, and the predictions from neighboring planes were
regularized by enforcing continuity around the annulus. Applying the final model 
and postprocessing to the test set data gave a mean error of 2.0 mm - with a
standard deviation of 1.9 mm. Fully automatic segmentation of the mitral annulus 
can alleviate the need for manual interaction in the quantification of an array
of mitral annular parameters and has the potential to eliminate inter-observer
variability.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31831455.pdf

risk of right ventricular failure remains difficult. The aim was to identify the 
most accurate predictors of right ventricular failure among clinical, biological,
and imaging markers, assessed by agreement of different supervised machine
learning algorithms.
METHODS: Seventy-four patients, referred to HeartWare left ventricular assist
device since 2010 in two Italian centers, were recruited. Biomarkers, right
ventricular standard, and strain echocardiography, as well as cath-lab measures, 
were compared among patients who did not develop right ventricular failure
(N = 56), those with acute-right ventricular failure (N = 8, 11%) or
chronic-right ventricular failure (N = 10, 14%). Logistic regression, penalized
logistic regression, linear support vector machines, and naïve Bayes algorithms
with leave-one-out validation were used to evaluate the efficiency of any
combination of three collected variables in an ""all-subsets"" approach.
RESULTS: Michigan risk score combined with central venous pressure assessed
invasively and apical longitudinal systolic strain of the right ventricular-free 
wall were the most significant predictors of acute-right ventricular failure
(maximum receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve = 0.95, 95%
confidence interval = 0.91-1.00, by the naïve Bayes), while the right
ventricular-free wall systolic strain of the middle segment, right atrial strain 
(QRS-synced), and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion were the most
significant predictors of Chronic-RVF (receiver operating characteristic-area
under the curve = 0.97, 95% confidence interval = 0.91-1.00, according to naïve
Bayes).
CONCLUSION: Apical right ventricular strain as well as right atrial strain
provides complementary information, both critical to predict acute-right
ventricular failure and chronic-right ventricular failure, respectively.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31830841.pdf

providing intelligent decision making to address challenges of critical care. CDS
systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also
utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy
course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and
outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision
support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability,
respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed,
ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were
systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between
2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with 
more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on
hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the
most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For
respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and
prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and
clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and
natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas
were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site
infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine
Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector
machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks.
Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported
performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine
Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training
these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such 
as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations
are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems.

tools for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential heart problems.
However, most of the current ECG report records remain on the paper, which makes 
it difficult to preserve and analyze the data. Moreover, paper records could
result in the loss significant data, which brings inconvenience to the subsequent
clinical diagnosis or artificial intelligence-assisted heart health diagnosis.
Taking digital pictures is an intuitive way of preserving these files and can be 
done simply using smartphones or any other devices with cameras. However, these
real scene ECG images often have some image noise that hinders signal extraction.
How to eliminate image noise and extract ECG binary image automatically from the 
noisy and low-quality real scene images of ECG reports is the first problem to be
solved in this paper. Next, QRS recognition is implemented on the extracted
binary images to determine key points of ECG signals. 1D digital ECG signal is
also extracted for accessing the exact values of the extracted points. In light
of these tasks, an automatic digital ECG signal extraction and normal QRS
recognition from real scene ECG images is proposed in this paper.
METHODS: The normal QRS recognition approach for real scene ECG images in this
paper consists of two steps: ECG binary image extraction from ECG images using a 
new two-layer hierarchical method, and the subsequent QRS recognition based on a 
novel feature-fusing method. ECG binary image extraction is implemented using
sub-channel filters followed by an adaptive filtering algorithm. According to the
ratio between pixel and real value of ECG binary image, 1D digital ECG signal is 
obtained. The normal QRS recognition includes three main steps: establishment of 
candidate point sets, feature fusion extraction, and QRS recognition. Two
datasets are introduced for evaluation including a real scene ECG images dataset 
and the public Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Database (FECG).
RESULTS: Through the experiment on real scene ECG image, the F1 score for Q, R, S
detection is 0.841, 0.992, and 0.891, respectively. The evaluation on the public 
FECG dataset also proves the robustness of our algorithm, where F1 score for R is
0.992 (0.996 for thoracic lead) and 0.988 for thoracic S wave.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method in this article is a promising tool for
automatically extracting digital ECG signals and detecting QRS complex in real
scene ECG images with normal QRS.

the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic
kidney disease. Related modified amino acids formed by proteolysis are excreted
in urine. We quantified urinary levels of these metabolites and branched-chain
amino acids (BCAAs) in healthy subjects and assessed changes in early-stage
decline in metabolic, vascular, and renal health and explored their diagnostic
utility for a noninvasive health screen. We recruited 200 human subjects with
early-stage health decline and healthy controls. Urinary amino acid metabolites
were determined by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry. Machine learning was applied to optimise and validate
algorithms to discriminate between study groups for potential diagnostic utility.
Urinary analyte changes were as follows: impaired metabolic health-increased N ε 
-carboxymethyl-lysine, glucosepane, glutamic semialdehyde, and pyrraline;
impaired vascular health-increased glucosepane; and impaired renal
health-increased BCAAs and decreased N ε -(γ-glutamyl)lysine. Algorithms
combining subject age, BMI, and BCAAs discriminated between healthy controls and 
impaired metabolic, vascular, and renal health study groups with accuracy of 84%,
72%, and 90%, respectively. In 2-step analysis, algorithms combining subject age,
BMI, and urinary N ε -fructosyl-lysine and valine discriminated between healthy
controls and impaired health (any type), accuracy of 78%, and then between types 
of health impairment with accuracy of 69%-78% (cf. random selection 33%). From
likelihood ratios, this provided small, moderate, and conclusive evidence of
early-stage cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease with diagnostic odds
ratios of 6 - 7, 26 - 28, and 34 - 79, respectively. We conclude that measurement
of urinary glycated, oxidized, crosslinked, and branched-chain amino acids
provides the basis for a noninvasive health screen for early-stage health decline
in metabolic, vascular, and renal health.

prevalent allergies associated with seafood consumption in the United States.
Typical symptoms range from mild itching up to fatal cardiovascular collapse seen
in anaphylaxis. In this paper, we demonstrate rapid, sensitive, and quantitative 
detection of histamine in both artificially spoiled tuna solution and real
spoiled tuna samples using thin layer chromatography in tandem with
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (TLC-SERS) sensing methods, enabled by machine 
learning analysis based on support vector regression (SVR) after feature
extraction with principal component analysis (PCA). The TLC plates used herein,
which were made from commercial food-grade diatomaceous earth, served
simultaneously as the stationary phase to separate histamine from the blended
tuna meat and as ultra-sensitive SERS substrates to enhance the detection limit. 
Using a simple drop cast method to dispense gold colloidal nanoparticles onto the
diatomaceous earth plate, we were able to directly detect histamine concentration
in artificially spoiled tuna solution down to 10 ppm. Based on the TLC-SERS
spectral data of real tuna samples spoiled at room temperature for 0 to 48 hours,
we used the PCA-SVR quantitative model to achieve superior predictive performance
exceling traditional partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. This work
proves that diatomaceous earth based TLC-SERS technique combined with
machine-learning analysis is a cost-effective, reliable, and accurate approach
for on-site detection and quantification of seafood allergen to enhance food

cholesterol, TG, HbA1c, Apo AI, Apo AII, Apo B, CRP, TNF-α, glucose, and fasting 
blood glucose among diabetic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. We
searched articles in six database engines, and 16 of the 696 articles reviewed
met the inclusion criteria. Among these, lipid and inflammatory biomarkers
investigated commonly included total cholesterol (11 studies), LDL, and TG (10

clinical phase drug development failure. Explanations could include the poor
external validity of pre-clinical (cell, tissue, and animal) models of human
disease and the high false discovery rate (FDR) in preclinical science. FDR is
related to the proportion of true relationships available for discovery (γ), and 
the type 1 (false-positive) and type 2 (false negative) error rates of the
experiments designed to uncover them. We estimated the FDR in preclinical
science, its effect on drug development success rates, and improvements expected 
from use of human genomics rather than preclinical studies as the primary source 
of evidence for drug target identification. Calculations were based on a sample
space defined by all human diseases - the 'disease-ome' - represented as columns;
and all protein coding genes - 'the protein-coding genome'- represented as rows, 
producing a matrix of unique gene- (or protein-) disease pairings. We
parameterised the space based on 10,000 diseases, 20,000 protein-coding genes,
100 causal genes per disease and 4000 genes encoding druggable targets, examining
the effect of varying the parameters and a range of underlying assumptions, on
the inferences drawn. We estimated γ, defined mathematical relationships between 
preclinical FDR and drug development success rates, and estimated improvements in
success rates based on human genomics (rather than orthodox preclinical studies).
Around one in every 200 protein-disease pairings was estimated to be causal
(γ = 0.005) giving an FDR in preclinical research of 92.6%, which likely makes a 
major contribution to the reported drug development failure rate of 96%. Observed
success rate was only slightly greater than expected for a random pick from the
sample space. Values for γ back-calculated from reported preclinical and clinical
drug development success rates were also close to the a priori estimates.
Substituting genome wide (or druggable genome wide) association studies for
preclinical studies as the major information source for drug target
identification was estimated to reverse the probability of late stage failure
because of the more stringent type 1 error rate employed and the ability to
interrogate every potential druggable target in the same experiment. Genetic
studies conducted at much larger scale, with greater resolution of disease
end-points, e.g. by connecting genomics and electronic health record data within

There is substantial evidence
that lifestyle modifications and drug intervention can prevent diabetes,
therefore, an early identification of high risk individuals is important to
design targeted prevention strategies. In this paper, we present an automatic
tool that uses machine learning techniques to predict the development of type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data generated from an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) was used to develop a predictive model based on the support vector machine
(SVM). We trained and validated the models using the OGTT and demographic data of
1,492 healthy individuals collected during the San Antonio Heart Study. This
study collected plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before glucose intake
and at three time-points thereafter (30, 60 and 120 min). Furthermore, personal
information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index was also a part of the
data-set. Using 11 OGTT measurements, we have deduced 61 features, which are then
assigned a rank and the top ten features are shortlisted using minimum redundancy
maximum relevance feature selection algorithm. All possible combinations of the
10 best ranked features were used to generate SVM based prediction models. This
research shows that an individual's plasma glucose levels, and the information
derived therefrom have the strongest predictive performance for the future
development of T2DM. Significantly, insulin and demographic features do not
provide additional performance improvement for diabetes prediction. The results
of this work identify the parsimonious clinical data needed to be collected for

an excellent system for understanding the regulatory mechanism that maintains the

that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) proteins are endogenously expressed during

diversity in mesoderm differentiation. Small molecule LY294002 inhibits the IGF
pathway to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation while suppressing epicardial and

cardiomyocyte features and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms
underlying cardiac differentiation. We further show that LY294002 induces
cardiomyocytes through CK2 pathway inhibition. This study elucidates the crucial 
roles of endogenous IGF in mesoderm differentiation and shows that the inhibition
of the IGF pathway is an effective approach for generating cardiomyocytes.

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (GPIs) block the final common pathway
of platelet aggregation and enable potent inhibition in the peri-PCI period. In
recent years, however, the use of GPIs has decreased due to bleeding concerns and
the availability of more potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors. Cangrelor is an

suggested but not confirmed through adoptive transfer experiments, using tolerant
WT C57BL/6 animals challenged with either BALB/c or C3H grafts. However, the
importance of receptor-specificity has not been formally tested. Here, we utilize
the novel ovalbumin-specific B cell receptor transnuclear (OBI) mice in multiple

Breg-dependent allograft tolerance relies on antigen recognition by B cells.
Additionally, we identify that this Breg-dependent tolerance relies on the
function of transforming growth factor-β. Together, these experiments mark

is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets.
Using data from GARFIELD-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting

sequential measures of PT-INR within 30 days of enrolment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with
vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and had at least 3 measurements of PT-INR taken over 
the first 30 days after prescription were analyzed. The AI model was constructed 
with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory (LSTM) and
one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR
measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over
days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the AI
model at predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and death was assessed in a
validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting
major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using serial PT-INR values collected within 1 month after starting
VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range (TTR) at
predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial PT-INR 
values contain important information that can be analyzed by computer to help

to December 2017 that contained the following terms: [Obsessive] AND [Smartphone]
OR [phone] OR [Internet] OR [Device] OR [Wearable] OR [Mobile] OR [Machine
learning] OR [Artificial] OR [Biofeedback] OR [Neurofeedback] OR [Momentary] OR
[Computerized] OR [Heart rate variability] OR [actigraphy] OR [actimetry] OR
[digital] OR [virtual reality] OR [Tele] OR [video].
RESULTS: We analyzed 364 articles, of which 62 were included. Our review was
divided into 3 parts: prediction, assessment (including diagnosis, screening, and
monitoring), and intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The review showed that the place of connected objects, machine
learning, and remote monitoring has yet to be defined in OCD. Smartphone
assessment apps and the Web Screening Questionnaire demonstrated good sensitivity
and adequate specificity for detecting OCD symptoms when compared with a
full-length structured clinical interview. The ecological momentary assessment
procedure may also represent a worthy addition to the current suite of assessment
tools. In the field of intervention, CBT supported by smartphone, internet, or
computer may not be more effective than that delivered by a qualified
practitioner, but it is easy to use, well accepted by patients, reproducible, and
cost-effective. Finally, new technologies are enabling the development of new
therapies, including biofeedback and virtual reality, which focus on the learning
of coping skills. For them to be used, these tools must be properly explained and
tailored to individual physician and patient profiles.

responsible for 23 and 21% of deaths in Oklahoma and the USA, respectively, in
2016. We aimed to determine the prevalence by race/ethnicity and spatial
distribution of congenital anomalies to identify geographic and racial/ethnic
disparities, particularly among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN).
METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of anomalies by type and race/ethnicity
among 648,074 live births in Oklahoma from 1997 to 2009. Prevalence proportion
ratios (PPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson
regression. We used Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* to evaluate spatial clustering
for neural tube defects, critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs), and oral
clefts among births whose residence geocoded to the ZIP code or finer level.
RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anomalies among live births was 3.9%. Non-Hispanic
(NH) African American (PPR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.91), Asian/Pacific Islander
(PPR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.78), and Hispanic (PPR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.91)
children had a lower prevalence of anomalies compared to NH whites. The
prevalence in NH AI/AN children was similar to NH whites (PPR: 1.01, 95% CI:
0.97, 1.05). However, differences in specific types of anomalies were observed by
race/ethnicity. We observed no spatial autocorrelation for CCHD and oral clefts. 
Neural tube defects demonstrated spatial autocorrelation (p < .0001). Local hot
spots varied by anomaly.
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of anomalies by race/ethnicity and geography differed 
by race/ethnicity and region, though this varied by anomaly. Additional research 
is needed to identify behavioral or environmental factors to target for
prevention.

still maintaining an active biochemical state. Dysregulation of these activities 
has been implicated in diseases such as age-related cataracts. However, the
lenticular protein dynamics underlying health and disease is unclear. We sought
to measure the global protein turnover rates in the eye using nitrogen-15
labeling of mice and mass spectrometry. We measured the 14N/15N-peptide ratios of
248 lens proteins, including Crystallin, Aquaporin, Collagen and enzymes that
catalyze glycolysis and oxidation/reduction reactions. Direct comparison of lens 
cortex versus nucleus revealed little or no 15N-protein contents in most nuclear 
proteins, while there were a broad range of 14N/15N ratios in cortex proteins.
Unexpectedly, like Crystallins, many enzymes with relatively high abundance in
nucleus were also exceedingly long-lived. The slow replacement of these enzymes
in spite of young age of mice suggests their potential roles in age-related
metabolic changes in the lens.

formation, and blockage of the blood flow supplying the heart tissue. Several
studies have shown that hemodynamics play an important role in the growth of
coronary artery plaques. Specifically, low wall shear stress (WSS) appears to be 
the leading hemodynamic parameter promoting atherosclerotic plaque growth, which 
in turn influences the blood flow and WSS distribution. Therefore, a two-way
coupled interaction exists between WSS and atherosclerosis growth. In this work, 
a computational framework was developed to study the coupling between WSS and
plaque growth in coronary arteries. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used
to quantify WSS distribution. Surface mesh nodes were moved in the inward normal 
direction according to a growth model based on WSS. After each growth stage, the 
geometry was updated and the CFD simulation repeated to find updated WSS values
for the next growth stage. One hundred twenty growth stages were simulated in an 
idealized tube and an image-based left anterior descending artery. An automated
framework was developed using open-source software to couple CFD simulations with
growth. Changes in plaque morphology and hemodynamic patterns during different
growth stages are presented. The results show larger plaque growth towards the
downstream segment of the plaque, agreeing with the reported clinical
observations. The developed framework could be used to establish
hemodynamic-driven growth models and study the interaction between these
processes.

monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary
outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e.,
Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based
algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model,
calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and
PWV. We recorded 16 nonfatal cardiovascular events (5 myocardial infarctions, 5
episodes of heart failure, and 6 strokes). The adjusted hazard ratio for PWV was 
1.199 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.37, p < 0.001). Arterial stiffness was a
predictor of cardiovascular disease development, as determined by PWV in a
high-risk population. Thus, in obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with

increasing concordance of target lesion measurements with oncology records using 
radiology preprocessors (RP). Faster notification of incidental actionable
findings to referring clinicians and clinical radiologist exam interpretation
time savings with RPs quantifying tumor burden were also assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective quality improvement initiative, RPs
annotated lesions before radiologist interpretation of CT exams. Clinical
radiologists then hyperlinked approved measurements into interactive reports
during interpretations. RPs evaluated concordance with our tumor measurement
radiologist, the determinant of tumor burden. Actionable finding detection and
notification times were also deduced. Clinical radiologist interpretation times
were calculated from established average CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis
interpretation times.
RESULTS: RPs assessed 1287 body CT exams with 812 follow-up CT chest, abdomen,
and pelvis studies; 95 (11.7%) of which had 241 verified target lesions. There
was improved concordance (67.8% vs. 22.5%) of target lesion measurements. RPs
detected 93.1% incidental actionable findings with faster clinician notification 
by a median time of 1 hour (range: 15 minutes-16 hours). Radiologist exam
interpretation times decreased by 37%.
CONCLUSIONS: This workflow resulted in three-fold improved target lesion
measurement concordance with oncology records, earlier detection and faster
notification of incidental actionable findings to referring clinicians, and
decreased exam interpretation times for clinical radiologists. These findings
demonstrate potential roles for automation (such as AI) to improve report value, 
worklist prioritization, and patient care.

2% on average and it is as high as 17% when accompanied by cardiovascular
diseases in China. It has been the most significant cause of postoperative death 
of patients. However, the patient is managed by the flow of information during
the operation, but a lot of clinical information can make it difficult for
medical staff to identify the information relevant to patient care. There are
major practical and technical barriers to understand perioperative complications.
METHODS: In this work, we present three machine learning methods to estimate
risks of heart failure, which extract intraoperative vital signs monitoring data 
into different modal representations (statistical learning representation, text
learning representation, image learning representation). Firstly, we extracted
features of vital signs monitoring data of surgical patients by statistical
analysis. Secondly, the vital signs data is converted into text information by
Piecewise Approximate Aggregation (PAA) and Symbolic Aggregate Approximation
(SAX), then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to extract text
topics of patients for heart failure prediction. Thirdly, the vital sign
monitoring time series data of the surgical patient is converted into a grid
image by using the grid representation, and then the convolutional neural network
is directly used to identify the grid image for heart failure prediction. We
evaluated the proposed methods in the monitoring data of real patients during the
perioperative period.
RESULTS: In this paper, the results of our experiment demonstrate the Gradient
Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classifier achieves the best results in the
prediction of heart failure by statistical feature representation. The
sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) of the best method
can reach 83, 85 and 84% respectively.

model of vital signs monitoring data of intraoperative patients can effectively
capture the physiological characteristics of postoperative heart failure.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31818298.pdf

use of software packages and tools to convey workflows and to streamline data
analysis. On the other hand, computational biology offers the contextual approach
to the functional characterization of metabolite profiles from a dataset,
providing ontologies and annotations. In this chapter, we discuss the main
technical procedures used in metabolomics data acquisition, data processing and
pipelines, followed by data mining and statistical approaches including machine
learning, and ultimately how metabolomics data can aid in elucidating aberrant

The ability to predict the
risk of developing hypertension could contribute to disease prevention
strategies. This study used machine learning techniques to develop and validate a
new risk prediction model for new-onset hypertension. In Japan, Industrial Safety
and Health Law requires employers to provide annual health checkups to their
employees. We used 2005-2016 health checkup data from 18 258 individuals, at the 
time of hypertension diagnosis [Year (0)] and in the two previous annual visits
[Year (-1) and Year (-2)]. Data were entered into models based on machine
learning methods (XGBoost and ensemble) or traditional statistical methods
(logistic regression). Data were randomly split into a derivation set (75%,
n = 13 694) used for model construction and development, and a validation set
(25%, n = 4564) used to test performance of the derived models. The best
predictor in the XGBoost model was systolic blood pressure during cardio-ankle
vascular index measurement at Year (-1). Area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve values in the validation cohort were 0.877, 0.881, and 0.859
for the XGBoost, ensemble, and logistic regression models, respectively. We have 
developed a highly precise prediction model for future hypertension using machine
learning methods in a general normotensive population. This could be used to
identify at-risk individuals and facilitate earlier non-pharmacological
intervention to prevent the future development of hypertension.

disease (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers and

research showed that an artificial neural network (ANN) is a suitable tool for
algorithmic MetS diagnostics, that includes solely non-invasive, low-cost and
easily-obtainabled (NI&LC&EO) diagnostic methods. This paper considers using four
well-known machine learning methods (linear regression, artificial neural
network, decision tree and random forest) for MetS predictions and provides their
comparison, in order to induce and facilitate development of appropriate medical 
software by using these methods. Training, validation and testing are conducted
on the large dataset that includes 3000 persons. Input vectors are very simple
and contain the following parameters: gender, age, body mass index,
waist-to-height ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, while the output
is MetS diagnosis in true/false form, made in accordance with International
Diabetes Federation (IDF). Comparison leads to the conclusion that random forest 
achieves the highest specificity (SPC=0.9436), sensitivity (SNS=0.9154), positive
(PPV=0.9379) and negative (NPV=0.9150) predictive values. Algorithmic diagnosis
of MetS could be beneficial in everyday clinical practice since it can easily

heart disease such as arrhythmia due to its simplicity and non-invasive nature.
Arrhythmia can be classified into many types, including life-threatening and
non-life-threatening. Accurate detection of arrhythmic types can effectively
prevent heart disease and reduce mortality.
METHODS: In this study, a novel deep learning method for classification of
cardiac arrhythmia according to deep residual network (ResNet) is presented. We
developed a 31-layer one-dimensional (1D) residual convolutional neural network. 
The algorithm includes four residual blocks, each of which consists of three 1D
convolution layers, three batch normalization (BP) layers, three rectified linear
unit (ReLU) layers, and an ""identity shortcut connections"" structure. In
addition, we propose to use 2-lead ECG signals in combination with deep learning 
methods to automatically identify five different types of heartbeats.
RESULTS: We have obtained an average accuracy, sensitivity and positive
predictivity of 99.06%, 93.21% and 96.76% respectively for single-lead ECG
heartbeats. In the 2-lead datasets, the results show that the deep ResNet model
has high classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.38%, sensitivity
of 94.54%, and specificity of 98.14%.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method can be used as an adjunct tool to assist

depletion is associated with the hallmarks of ageing and may contribute to a wide
range of age-related diseases including metabolic disorders, cancer, and
neurodegenerative diseases. One of the central pathways by which NAD+ promotes
healthy ageing is through regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis via
mitochondrial biogenesis and the clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy.
Here, we highlight the contribution of the NAD+-mitophagy axis to ageing and
age-related diseases, and evaluate how boosting NAD+ levels may emerge as a
promising therapeutic strategy to counter ageing as well as neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer's disease. The potential use of artificial
intelligence to understand the roles and molecular mechanisms of the
NAD+-mitophagy axis in ageing is discussed, including possible applications in
drug target identification and validation, compound screening and lead compound
discovery, biomarker development, as well as efficacy and safety assessment.
Advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular roles of NAD+ in
mitophagy will lead to novel approaches for facilitating healthy mitochondrial
homoeostasis that may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy to counter

health were based on the daily scale, few were at the hourly level. Revealing the
relationship between unfavorable temperatures on an hourly basis and health is
conducive to the development of more accurate extreme temperature early warning
systems and reasonable dispatch of ambulances.
METHODS: Hourly data on temperature, air pollution (including PM2.5, O3, SO2 and 
NO2) and emergency ambulance calls (EACs) for all-cause, cardiovascular and
respiratory diseases from January 16, 2014 to December 31, 2016 were obtained
from Luoyang, China. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to assess
the association between hourly temperature and ambulance calls after adjusting
for potential confounding factors. The fractions of EACs attributable to
non-optimum temperatures were also estimated.
RESULTS: Hourly temperature was associated with increased ambulance calls with a 
varying lag pattern. Extreme hot temperature (>32.1 °C) was positively associated
with all-cause, cardiovascular diseases at lag 0-30 h and lag 0-9 h, while no
significant effects were found for respiratory morbidity. Extreme cold
temperature (<-2.5 °C) was positively associated with all-cause, cardiovascular
and respiratory morbidity at lag 56-157 h, 50-145 h and 123-170 h. An overall
EACs fraction of 6.84% [Backward estimate, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.01%,
8.59%] could be attributed to non-optimum temperatures, and more contributions
were caused by cold [Backward estimate: 6.06% (95% CI: 5.10%, 8.48%)] than by
heat [Backward estimate: 0.79% (95% CI: 0.12%, 1.45%)].
CONCLUSIONS: Extreme hot temperature may lead to increased ambulance calls within
a few hours, while extreme cold temperature may not increase ambulance calls
until more than 2 days later. Effective measures, such as forming hourly
temperature warning standards, optimizing ambulance services at extreme
temperatures, etc., should be taken to reduce the unfavorable temperature -
associated EACs burden.

robust B cell clonal expansion in the graft but not in the blood for all cases.
Several expanded B cell clones, characterized by their uniquely rearranged
complementarity-determining region 3, were detected in different locations in the
graft. Sequences from intragraft B cells also showed elevated levels of mutated
rearrangements in the graft compared to blood B cells. The number of somatic
mutations per rearrangement was also higher in the graft than in the blood,
suggesting that B cells continued maturing in situ. Overall, our studies
demonstrated B cell clonal expansion in human cardiac allografts with CAV. This
local B cell response may contribute to the pathophysiology of CAV through a
mechanism that needs to be identified.

proliferated in vivo, contributed to viral control, and were marked by an
effector-like transcriptional signature including expression of the chemokine
receptor CX3CR1, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and granzyme B. PD-1 pathway
blockade increased the numbers of CD101-Tim3+ CD8+ T cells, suggesting that these
newly generated transitional cells play a critical role in PD-1-based
immunotherapy.

repositories led to an exponential increase in the workload of researchers
involved in citation screening for systematic reviews. This work aims to combine 
machine learning techniques and data preprocessing for class imbalance to
identify the outperforming strategy to screen articles in PubMed for inclusion in
systematic reviews.
METHODS: We trained four binary text classifiers (support vector machines,
k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and elastic-net regularized generalized linear
models) in combination with four techniques for class imbalance: random
undersampling and oversampling with 50:50 and 35:65 positive to negative class
ratios and none as a benchmark. We used textual data of 14 systematic reviews as 
case studies. Difference between cross-validated area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for machine learning techniques with and
without preprocessing (delta AUC) was estimated within each systematic review,
separately for each classifier. Meta-analytic fixed-effect models were used to
pool delta AUCs separately by classifier and strategy.
RESULTS: Cross-validated AUC-ROC for machine learning techniques (excluding
k-nearest neighbor) without preprocessing was prevalently above 90%. Except for
k-nearest neighbor, machine learning techniques achieved the best improvement in 
conjunction with random oversampling 50:50 and random undersampling 35:65.
CONCLUSIONS: Resampling techniques slightly improved the performance of the
investigated machine learning techniques. From a computational perspective,
random undersampling 35:65 may be preferred.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31810495.pdf

responses, behavioral patterns, and environmental factors. However, most methods 
for determining embodied emotion has been considered on only fragmentary
independent variables and not their inter-connectivity. This study suggests a
method for determining the embodied emotion considering interactions among three 
factors: the physiological response, behavioral patterns, and an environmental
factor based on life-logging. The physiological response was analyzed as heart
rate variability (HRV) variables. The behavioral pattern was calculated from
features of Global Positioning System (GPS) locations that indicate
spatiotemporal property. The environmental factor was analyzed as the ambient
noise, which is an external stimulus. These data were mapped with the emotion of 
that time. The emotion was evaluated on a seven-point scale for arousal level and
valence level according to Russell's model of emotion. These data were collected 
from 79 participants in daily life for two weeks. Their relationships among data 
were analyzed by the multiple regression analysis, after pre-processing the
respective data. As a result, significant differences between the arousal level
and valence level of emotion were observed based on their relations. The
contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) The emotion was
recognized in real-life for a more practical application; (2) distinguishing the 
interactions that determine the levels of arousal and positive emotion by
analyzing relationships of individuals' life-log data. Through this, it was
verified that emotion can be changed according to the interaction among the three
factors, which was overlooked in previous emotion recognition.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31810275.pdf

criteria are poor predictors of the functional significance of intermediate
coronary stenosis. IVUS-based supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms were
developed to identify lesions with a fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80 (vs.
>0.80).
METHODS: A total of 1328 patients with 1328 non-left main coronary lesions were
randomized into training and test sets in a 4:1 ratio. Masked IVUS images were
generated by an automatic segmentation model, and 99 computed IVUS features and
six clinical variables (age, gender, body surface area, vessel type, involved
segment, and involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery) were
used for ML training with 5-fold cross-validation. Diagnostic performances of the
binary classifiers (L2 penalized logistic regression, artificial neural network, 
random forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and support vector machine) for detecting
ischemia-producing lesions were evaluated using the non-overlapping test samples.
RESULTS: In the classification of test set lesions into those with an FFR ≤0.80
vs. >0.80, the overall diagnostic accuracies for predicting an FFR ≤0.80 were 82%
with L2 penalized logistic regression, 80% with artificial neural network, 83%
with random forest, 83% with AdaBoost, 81% with CatBoost, and 81% with support
vector machine (AUCs: 0.84-0.87). With exclusion of the 28 lesions with
borderline FFR of 0.75-0.80, the overall accuracies for the test set were 86%
with L2 penalized logistic regression, 85% with an artificial neural network, 87%
with random forest, 87% with AdaBoost, 85% with CatBoost, and 85% with support

CONCLUSIONS: The IVUS-based ML algorithms showed good diagnostic performance for 
identifying ischemia-producing lesions, and may reduce the need for pressure
wires.

highly-sensitive gel filtration columns.
METHODS: In this phase 4, randomized, open-label study, patients with
dyslipidemia receiving statins were randomized 1:1 to Omega-3 treatment (oral
Omega-3 2 g twice daily) or Control (no Omega-3). Primary endpoint was change in 
mean particle size of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and small dense LDL
(cholesterol monitoring) in the specific 20-lipoprotein fraction assay. Secondary
endpoints included changes in lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein
concentrations in fasting blood. Changes were compared between treatments using
analysis of covariance, adjusted by baseline fasting triglycerides and age.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were randomized (Omega-3, n = 24; Control, n = 29).
The difference in LDL particle size between Omega-3 and Control groups was
significant at week 8 (p = 0.0040). Differences in least squares mean change in
concentration from baseline to week 8 between Omega-3 and Control groups were
significant for total cholesterol (p = 0.0009), LDL-C (p = 0.0442),
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.0009), and remnant
lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = 0.0396). Differences were significant for
apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, B-48, B-100, CII, CIII, and CII/III, but not
apolipoprotein E.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant increases in LDL particle sizes and significant
decreases in blood lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were
observed with Omega-3 compared with Control. Omega-3 may improve blood lipid
profile and increase LDL particle size, resulting in an anti-atherogenic profile.

that PPIs are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among 
patients with preexisting CV disease. However, little is known about their risk

METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study in the UK Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD to evaluate the association between PPI use and
risk of MI in patients without known CV disease. From among PPIs users aged 25 to
65 between 1988 and 2017, we identified 32793 MI cases and 127291 controls
matched 4:1 on age, sex, general practice setting, and calendar time. Using
logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for MI comparing PPI users to non-users, adjusting for body mass index,
smoking, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. We repeated this analysis in users
of histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RA), a drug with a similar indication, to 
assess protopathic bias.
RESULTS: The risk of MI was elevated in new users of PPIs with one to five
prescriptions (adjusted OR 2.8 95%CI 2.6-3.0), but not in any other exposure
category. The results among H2RA users were similar across all exposure
categories, suggesting that protopathic bias likely explains the results.

noncoding germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated
with an increased risk of developing cancer. However, how these SNPs affect
cancer risk is still largely unknown.
METHODS: We used a systems biology approach to analyse the regulatory role of
cancer-risk SNPs in thirteen tissues. By using data from the Genotype-Tissue
Expression (GTEx) project, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) analysis. We represented both significant cis- and trans-eQTLs as edges in
tissue-specific eQTL bipartite networks.
RESULTS: Each tissue-specific eQTL network is organised into communities that
group sets of SNPs and functionally related genes. When mapping cancer-risk SNPs 
to these networks, we find that in each tissue, these SNPs are significantly
overrepresented in communities enriched for immune response processes, as well as
tissue-specific functions. Moreover, cancer-risk SNPs are more likely to be
'cores' of their communities, influencing the expression of many genes within the
same biological processes. Finally, cancer-risk SNPs preferentially target
oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes, suggesting that they may alter the
expression of these key cancer genes.

Recent advances in transcriptional profiling methods have enabled classification 
of cell types by their gene expression. While exceptionally powerful and high
throughput, the ground-truth validation of these methods is difficult: If cell
type is unknown, how does one assess whether a given analysis accurately captures
neuronal identity? To shed light on the capabilities and limitations of solely
using transcriptional profiling for cell-type classification, we performed 2
forms of transcriptional profiling-RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR, in single,
unambiguously identified neurons from 2 small crustacean neuronal networks: The
stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia. We then combined our knowledge of cell type
with unbiased clustering analyses and supervised machine learning to determine
how accurately functionally defined neuron types can be classified by expression 
profile alone. The results demonstrate that expression profile is able to capture
neuronal identity most accurately when combined with multimodal information that 
allows for post hoc grouping, so analysis can proceed from a supervised
perspective. Solely unsupervised clustering can lead to misidentification and an 
inability to distinguish between 2 or more cell types. Therefore, this study
supports the general utility of cell identification by transcriptional profiling,
but adds a caution: It is difficult or impossible to know under what conditions
transcriptional profiling alone is capable of assigning cell identity. Only by
combining multiple modalities of information such as physiology, morphology, or
innervation target can neuronal identity be unambiguously determined.

education and smoking during pregnancy, household income and smoking, and
neighbourhood characteristics. In secondary analysis, we additionally adjusted
for asthma. More than 2 hours spent watching TV was associated with 10% lower
FeNO (95% confidence interval [CI]: -20, 0%). Higher body fat percentage was also
associated with lower FeNO. After additional adjustment for asthma, teens who are
underweight (BMI <5th %tile, 3%) had 22% lower FeNO (95%CI: -40, 2%) and teens
who are overweight (BMI ≥85th %ile, 28%) had 13% lower FeNO (95%CI: -23, -2%).

diagnose CHD at the earlier stage; hospitals diagnose it based on various types
of medical tests. Thus, by predicting high-risk people who are to suffer from
CHD, it is significant to reduce the risks of developing CHD. In recent years,
some research works have been done using data mining to predict the risk of
developing diseases based on medical tests. In this study, we have proposed a
reconstruction error (RE) based deep neural networks (DNNs); this approach uses a
deep autoencoder (AE) model for estimating RE. Initially, a training dataset is
divided into two groups by their RE divergence on the deep AE model that learned 
from the whole training dataset. Next, two DNN classifiers are trained on each
group of datasets separately by combining a RE based new feature with other risk 
factors to predict the risk of developing CHD. For creating the new feature, we
use deep AE model that trained on the only high-risk dataset. We have performed

that reliably predicts hospital mortality in children with acute infections
residing in low- and middle-income countries, using age and other variables
collected at hospital admission.
DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a single-center, prospective, before-and-after
feasibility trial.
SETTING: Rural district hospital in Rwanda, a low-income country in Sub-Sahara
Africa.
PATIENTS: Infants and children greater than 28 days and less than 18 years of
life hospitalized because of an acute infection.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate,
and temperature) capillary refill time, altered mental state collected at
hospital admission, as well as survival status at hospital discharge were
extracted from the trial database. This information was collected for 1,579 adult
and pediatric patients admitted to a regional referral hospital with an acute
infection in rural Rwanda. Nine-hundred forty-nine children were included in this
analysis. We predicted survival in study subjects using random forests, a machine
learning algorithm. Five prediction models, all including age plus two to five
other variables, were tested. Three distinct optimization criteria of the
algorithm were then compared. The in-hospital mortality was 1.5% (n = 14). All
five models could predict in-hospital mortality with an area under the receiver

Generalized estimated equations (GEEs) were used to examine the following
associations: (1) the cross-sectional associations of diet quality (as determined
by AHEI) with serum lipoproteins (n = 2200); and (2) the prospective associations

diuretic initiation is uncertain in CKD.We describe the frequency and time
interval of lab monitoring during initiation of RAASi and diuretics in CKD and
assess whether close lab monitoring associates with one-year risk of emergency
department (ED) visit or hospitalization.We evaluated an observational cohort of 
8,217 individuals with stage 3-5 non-dialysis CKD newly prescribed a RAASi
(52.3%) or diuretic (47.7%) from thirty-six primary care offices affiliated with

within 2 weeks, and 5957 (72.5%) did not have post-prescription labs done within 
2 weeks which includes 524 (6.4%) individuals without post-prescription within 1

posterior aspect of the internal carotid bulb, representing an intimal variant of
fibromuscular dysplasia. The diagnosis of CaW is traditionally restricted to
digital subtraction angiography (DSA), CT/MR angiography (CTA/MRA), and Duplex
ultrasonography. In this series of patients with acute ischemic stroke, we
evaluated the potential utility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in further
characterizing suspected CaWs.
METHODS: This is a case series of three patients with suspected CaW who underwent
DSA for treatment or investigation of large vessel occlusion strokes. In all
cases the stroke investigation failed to identify an alternative cause, and the
stroke etiology was attributed to a symptomatic CaW. The procedure consisted of
positioning a guide catheter in the common carotid artery, navigating the IVUS
probe distal to the carotid bulb, and then retracting the probe with a manual
pullback. The acquired images were then reviewed in an independent workstation
RESULTS: In two of the three cases, IVUS showed an isoechoic-to-hyperechoic focal
eccentric area at the posterior carotid bulb, consistent with CaW. The
endoluminal protrusion was inconspicuous on IVUS due to the low resolution of
ultrasound not allowing a clear differentiation between fibrosis, thrombosis, and
atherosclerosis. No abnormalities commonly associated with atherosclerotic
disease or dissections were noted. The CaW could not be depicted in the third
patient.
CONCLUSION: The use of IVUS in the diagnosis of CaW may have limited relevance.
Continued investigation of other imaging modalities for accurate CaW diagnosis is
recommended.

mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of 
hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review
of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We
highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.
Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in
glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the
expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron.
Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes 
mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics.
Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in
part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its
well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also
contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis.
Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of 
potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer
potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing
of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this
context.

treatment in most patients with cardiovascular disease, especially in those with 
heart failure (HF). The European Society of Cardiology and the American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association gave a Class IA recommendation for the
use of RAASi in the treatment of Classes II-IV symptomatic HF with reduced
ejection fraction (HFREF), based on their strong clinical benefits of lowering
all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations in these subjects. However, RAASi
therapy or adding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in subjects receiving
background angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers may be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (HK),
especially in those with reduced kidney function. As a result, a significant
proportion of these subjects either have RAASi dose reduced or more often
discontinued when they develop HK. Discontinuation of RAASi in patients
hospitalized with HFREF was associated with higher postdischarge mortality and
rehospitalization rates, while optimal dosing of RAASi significantly reduced
median hospital stays, outpatient visits and related costs. Thus, effective
treatment is required to lower potassium level and maintain normokalemia in
subjects with HF and reduced kidney disease who develop or are at risk of HK,
thus enabling them to continue their RAASi therapy and maximize benefits from
RAASi. In this review, we provide an up-to-date review of the prevalence and
significance of HK in patients with cardiorenal syndrome, as well as their
optimal management of HK with recent novel therapies.

clinical importance, the conventional diagnosis criteria for detecting LVH using 
electrocardiography (ECG) has not been satisfied. We aimed to develop an
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting LVH.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study involved the review of
21 286 patients who were admitted to two hospitals between October 2016 and July 
2018 and underwent 12-lead ECG and echocardiography within 4 weeks. The patients 
in one hospital were divided into a derivation and internal validation dataset,
while the patients in the other hospital were included in only an external
validation dataset. An AI algorithm based on an ensemble neural network (ENN)
combining convolutional and deep neural network was developed using the
derivation dataset. And we visualized the ECG area that the AI algorithm used to 
make the decision. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
the AI algorithm based on ENN was 0.880 (95% confidence interval 0.877-0.883) and
0.868 (0.865-0.871) during the internal and external validations. These results
significantly outperformed the cardiologist's clinical assessment with
Romhilt-Estes point system and Cornell voltage criteria, Sokolov-Lyon criteria,
and interpretation of ECG machine. At the same specificity, the AI algorithm
based on ENN achieved 159.9%, 177.7%, and 143.8% higher sensitivities than those 
of the cardiologist's assessment, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of
ECG machine.
CONCLUSION : An AI algorithm based on ENN was highly able to detect LVH and
outperformed cardiologists, conventional methods, and other machine learning
techniques.

diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large
multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in
genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more
carefully tailor early interventions- whether treatment or preventative in
nature-to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer 
capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable 
success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from
available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less
progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include
intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and
broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to
quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional
characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by
phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable
penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural
and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological
markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to
achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine
conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks
and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review we will examine
these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby artificial
intelligence may overcome them.

condition often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Despite increased awareness, the 
delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive
model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large
populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in
England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of
healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in
Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A
non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from
the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to ≤5
years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, 
medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For
modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate
between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of
2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
with ≥1 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using
cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen,
secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm's
performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity 
of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The
positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%,
respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial
intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases
such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide 
low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis,
improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. Studies to further validate this 
approach are warranted.

schisandrin B (Sch B) on myocardial hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in
mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into three groups: i) Sham (n=12);
ii) transverse aortic constriction (TAC) (n=12); and iii) Sch B-treated (n=12; 80
mg·kg-1·d-1 per gavage). The model of myocardial hypertrophy was established by
constricting the descending branch of the aortic arch. Following a 4-week
treatment period, cardiac remodeling was evaluated using echocardiography and
pathological and molecular analysis. Sch B improved cardiac function in the Sch
B-treated group compared with the TAC group. Moreover, the Sch B-treated group
had a smaller myocardial cell cross-sectional area and less fibrosis compared
with the TAC group. The protein expression levels of cardiac hypertrophy and
fibrosis markers in the TAC group were significantly higher compared with those
in the sham group. The same markers in the Sch B-treated group were significantly
lower compared with those in the TAC group. Additionally, the phosphorylation
levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway-associated proteins extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, c-Jun
N-terminal kinase 1/2 and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were significantly
lower in the Sch B-treated group compared with the TAC group. Further in vitro
investigation demonstrated that Sch B prevented the adverse effects of
angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy and fibrosis by inhibiting the MAPK signaling 
pathway in H9c2 cells. In conclusion, Sch B may improve pathological myocardial
remodeling and cardiac function induced by pressure overload, and its underlying 
mechanism may be associated with inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway.

motor skills. Previous studies seeking to understand the neural correlates
underlying motor memory consolidation that is modulated by exercise, have relied 
so far on using traditional statistical approaches for a priori selected features
from neuroimaging data, including EEG. With recent advances in machine learning, 
data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG
data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the
context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and
spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a
limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral
features within a refined frequency band (27-29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta
bandwidth (15-30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as
corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results
indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been
overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study
thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for
neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain
biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in drug addiction. However, the
mechanism underlying systems-level neuroadaptations in PFC during abstinence has 
not been fully characterized. The objective of our study was to determine what
neural oscillatory activity contributes to the chronic effect of opiate exposure 
and whether the activity could be coupled to neurovascular information in the
PFC. We employed resting-state functional connectivity to explore alterations in 
8 patients with heroin dependency who stayed abstinent (>3 months; HD) compared
with 11 control subjects. A non-invasive neuroimaging strategy was applied to
combine electrophysiological signals through electroencephalography (EEG) with
hemodynamic signals through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The
electrophysiological signals indicate neural synchrony and the oscillatory
activity, and the hemodynamic signals indicate blood oxygenation in small vessels
in the PFC. A supervised machine learning method was used to obtain associations 
between EEG and fNIRS modalities to improve precision and localization. HD
patients demonstrated desynchronized lower alpha rhythms and decreased
connectivity in PFC networks. Asymmetric excitability and cerebrovascular injury

nonlinear structure using an information-geometric distance between data points. 
We compare PHATE to other tools on a variety of artificial and biological

including continual progressions, branches and clusters, better than other tools.
We define a manifold preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding
manifold preservation (DEMaP), and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional
embeddings that are quantitatively better denoised as compared to existing
visualization methods. An analysis of a newly generated single-cell RNA
sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation demonstrates how PHATE

heart disease. However, substructures are not considered in radiation therapy
planning (RTP) due to poor visualization on CT. Therefore, we developed a novel
deep learning (DL) pipeline leveraging MRI's soft tissue contrast coupled with CT
for state-of-the-art cardiac substructure segmentation requiring a single,
non-contrast CT input.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Thirty-two left-sided whole-breast cancer patients underwent
cardiac T2 MRI and CT-simulation. A rigid cardiac-confined MR/CT registration
enabled ground truth delineations of 12 substructures (chambers, great vessels
(GVs), coronary arteries (CAs), etc.). Paired MRI/CT data (25 patients) were
placed into separate image channels to train a three-dimensional (3D) neural
network using the entire 3D image. Deep supervision and a Dice-weighted
multi-class loss function were applied. Results were assessed pre/post
augmentation and post-processing (3D conditional random field (CRF)). Results for
11 test CTs (seven unique patients) were compared to ground truth and a
multi-atlas method (MA) via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to
agreement (MDA), and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Three physicians evaluated
clinical acceptance via consensus scoring (5-point scale).
RESULTS: The model stabilized in ~19 h (200 epochs, training error <0.001).
Augmentation and CRF increased DSC 5.0 ± 7.9% and 1.2 ± 2.5%, across
substructures, respectively. DL provided accurate segmentations for chambers
(DSC = 0.88 ± 0.03), GVs (DSC = 0.85 ± 0.03), and pulmonary veins
(DSC = 0.77 ± 0.04). Combined DSC for CAs was 0.50 ± 0.14. MDA across
substructures was <2.0 mm (GV MDA = 1.24 ± 0.31 mm). No substructures had
statistical volume differences (P > 0.05) to ground truth. In four cases, DL
yielded left main CA contours, whereas MA segmentation failed, and provided
improved consensus scores in 44/60 comparisons to MA. DL provided clinically
acceptable segmentations for all graded patients for 3/4 chambers. DL contour
generation took ~14 s per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: These promising results suggest DL poses major efficiency and
accuracy gains for cardiac substructure segmentation offering high potential for 
rapid implementation into RTP for improved cardiac sparing.

crossover, single-dose phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of AZD5718 to investigate a 
potential drug-drug interaction with rosuvastatin, and the effects of formulation
and food intake (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02963116). Rosuvastatin
(10 mg) were absorbed more rapidly when coadministered with AZD5718 (200 mg),
probably owing to weak inhibition of hepatic statin uptake, but relative
bioavailability was unaffected (geometric least-squares mean ratio [GMR], 100%;
90% confidence interval [CI], 86%-116%). AZD5718 pharmacokinetics were unaffected
by coadministration of rosuvastatin. AZD5718 (200 mg) was absorbed less rapidly
when formulated as tablets than oral suspension, with reduced relative
bioavailability (GMR, 72%; 90%CI, 64%-80%). AZD5718 absorption was slower when
200-mg tablets were taken after a high-fat breakfast than after fasting, but
relative bioavailability was unaffected (GMR, 96%; 90%CI, 87%-106%). In post hoc

tested the effect of a variety of cardioprotective agents on cancer
therapy-induced cardiotoxicity, the number of included patients was limited, and 
the results remained controversial. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
preventive or therapeutic effects of cardioprotective agents on heart failure
(HF) caused by cardiotoxicity induced by cancer therapy.
METHODS: We included trials of the following cardioprotective drugs:
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers,
beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and stains. We extracted the relevant
information with predefined data extraction forms, and assessed the risk of bias 
in randomized controlled trials with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary 
outcome was the left ventricular ejection fraction of patients after
chemotherapy. We used the random-effects model to carry out pair-wise
meta-analysis, and then carry out the random-effects network meta-analysis within
the Bayesian framework.
RESULTS: Twenty-two relevant RCTs, including 1 916 patients (79.6 % women) with a
mean age of 48.4 years, were included. Based on the evaluation of all drug
species from 20 studies (26 comparisons), the analysis found that 4 therapies,

CI, 2.61-15.79]), and statin (MD, 8.36 [95 % CI, 0.36-16.36]) showed significant 
benefits in protecting left ventricular (LV) systolic function compared with the 
placebo and/or control.
CONCLUSION: When classified according to drug type, aldosterone antagonists,
ACEIs, statins, and beta-blockers could substantially improve the LV systolic
function. In the analysis classified by single drug or drug combination,
spironolactone, enalapril, and statin have a significant cardioprotective effect.
However, ARBs have no cardioprotective effect and fail to improve the LVEF.

comprehensive peptide detection and relative quantification than standard
data-dependent approaches. While less prone to missing values, these still exist.
Current approaches for handling so-called missingness have challenges. We
hypothesized that non-random missingness is a useful biological measure and
demonstrate the importance of analysing missingness for proteomic discovery
within a longitudinal study of disease activity.
RESULTS: The magnitude of missingness did not correlate with mean peptide
concentration. The magnitude of missingness for each protein strongly correlated 
between collection time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months; R = 0.95-0.97,
CI = 0.94, 0.97) indicating little time-dependent effect. This allowed for the
identification of proteins with outlier levels of missingness that differentiate 
between patient groups characterized by different patterns of disease activity.
The association of these proteins with disease activity was confirmed by machine 
learning techniques.
CONCLUSION: Our novel approach complements analyses on complete observations and 
other missing value strategies in biomarker prediction of disease activity.

affecting millions worldwide, and it results in many potential medical
complications throughout the life course. The hallmark of SCD is pain. Many
patients experience daily chronic pain as well as intermittent, unpredictable
acute vaso-occlusive painful episodes called pain crises. These pain crises often
require acute medical care through the day hospital or emergency department.
Following presentation, a number of these patients are subsequently admitted with
continued efforts of treatment focused on palliative pain control and hydration
for management. Mitigating pain crises is challenging for both the patients and
their providers, given the perceived unpredictability and subjective nature of
pain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to show the feasibility of using
objective, physiologic measurements obtained from a wearable device during an
acute pain crisis to predict patient-reported pain scores (in an app and to
nursing staff) using machine learning techniques.
METHODS: For this feasibility study, we enrolled 27 adult patients presenting to 
the day hospital with acute pain. At the beginning of pain treatment, each
participant was given a wearable device (Microsoft Band 2) that collected
physiologic measurements. Pain scores from our mobile app, Technology Resources
to Understand Pain Assessment in Patients with Pain, and those obtained by
nursing staff were both used with wearable signals to complete time stamp
matching and feature extraction and selection. Following this, we constructed
regression and classification machine learning algorithms to build
between-subject pain prediction models.
RESULTS: Patients were monitored for an average of 3.79 (SD 2.23) hours, with an 
average of 5826 (SD 2667) objective data values per patient. As expected, we
found that pain scores and heart rate decreased for most patients during the
course of their stay. Using the wearable sensor data and pain scores, we were
able to create a regression model to predict subjective pain scores with a root
mean square error of 1.430 and correlation between observations and predictions
of 0.706. Furthermore, we verified the hypothesis that the regression model
outperformed the classification model by comparing the performances of the
support vector machines (SVM) and the SVM for regression.
CONCLUSIONS: The Microsoft Band 2 allowed easy collection of objective,
physiologic markers during an acute pain crisis in adults with SCD. Features can 
be extracted from these data signals and matched with pain scores. Machine
learning models can then use these features to feasibly predict patient pain
scores.

IL-17A/F-dependent immunity at mucosal surfaces, whereas those of connective
tissue disorders (CTDs) often impair the TGF-β-dependent homeostasis of
connective tissues. The signaling pathways involved are incompletely understood. 
We report a three-generation family with an autosomal dominant (AD) combination
of CMC and a previously undescribed form of CTD that clinically overlaps with
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The patients are heterozygous for a private
splice-site variant of MAPK8, the gene encoding c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1),
a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. This variant is loss-of-expression and
loss-of-function in the patients' fibroblasts, which display AD JNK1 deficiency
by haploinsufficiency. These cells have impaired, but not abolished, responses to
IL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, the development of the patients' TH17 cells was
impaired ex vivo and in vitro, probably due to the involvement of JNK1 in the
TGF-β-responsive pathway and further accounting for the patients' CMC.
Consistently, the patients' fibroblasts displayed impaired JNK1- and
c-Jun/ATF-2-dependent induction of key extracellular matrix (ECM) components and 
regulators, but not of EDS-causing gene products, in response to TGF-β.
Furthermore, they displayed a transcriptional pattern in response to TGF-β
different from that of fibroblasts from patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome caused
by mutations of TGFBR2 or SMAD3, further accounting for the patients' complex and
unusual CTD phenotype. This experiment of nature indicates that the integrity of 
the human JNK1-dependent MAPK signaling pathway is essential for IL-17A- and
IL-17F-dependent mucocutaneous immunity to Candida and for the TGF-β-dependent
homeostasis of connective tissues.

variables and/or (2) using machine learning models improves cardiovascular death 
prediction versus standard Cox models without nutrition predictor variables.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Six waves of Survey (NHANES) data collected from 1999 to 2011 linked to 
the National Death Index (NDI).
PARTICIPANTS: 29 390 participants were included in the training set for model
derivation and 12 600 were included in the test set for model evaluation. Our
study sample was approximately 20% black race and 25% Hispanic ethnicity.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Time from NHANES interview until the
minimum of time of cardiovascular death or censoring.
RESULTS: A standard risk model excluding nutrition data overestimated risk nearly
two-fold (calibration slope of predicted vs true risk: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.50 to
0.55)) with moderate discrimination (C-statistic: 0.87 (0.86 to 0.89)). Nutrition
data alone failed to improve performance while machine learning alone improved
calibration to 1.18 (0.92 to 1.44) and discrimination to 0.91 (0.90 to 0.92).
Both together substantially improved calibration (slope: 1.01 (0.76 to 1.27)) and
discrimination (C-statistic: 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94)).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the inclusion of nutrition data with
available machine learning algorithms can substantially improve cardiovascular
risk prediction.

engineering and software modifications to the CorPath GRX Robotic System for
their ability to support safer and more effective cranial neurovascular
interventions in a preclinical model.
METHODS: Active device fixation (ADF) control software, permitting automated
manipulation of the guidewire relative to the microcatheter, and a modified drive
cassette suitable for neuroendovascular instruments were the respective software 
and hardware modifications to the current CorPath GRX robot, which was cleared by
the FDA for percutaneous coronary and peripheral vascular intervention. The
authors then trialed the modified system in a live porcine model with simulated
neuroendovascular pathology. Femoral access through the aortic arch to the common
carotid artery was accomplished manually (without robotic assistance), and the
remaining endovascular procedures were performed with robotic assistance. The
system was tested for the enhanced ability to navigate and manipulate
neurovascular-specific guidewires and microcatheters. The authors specifically
evaluated the movement of the wire forward and backward during the advancement of
the microcatheter.
RESULTS: Navigation of the rete mirabile and an induced aneurysm within the
common carotid artery were successful. The active device fixation feature enabled
independent advancement and retraction of the guidewire and working device
relative to the microcatheter. When ADF was inactive, the mean forward motion of 
the guidewire was 5 mm and backward motion was 0 mm. When ADF was active, the
mean forward motion of the guidewire was 0 mm and backward motion was 1.5 mm. The
modifications made to the robotic cassette enabled the system to successfully
manipulate the microcatheter and guidewire safely and in a manner more suited to 
neuroendovascular procedures than before. There were no occurrences of
dissection, extravasation, or thrombosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The robotic system was originally designed to navigate and
manipulate devices for cardiac and peripheral vascular intervention. The current 
modifications described here improved its utility for the more delicate and
tortuous neurovascular environment. This will set the stage for the development
of a neurovascular-specific robot.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31783367,Nan

because of the uncertain structure of the dynamic catalyst-substrate complex. The
Catabody Platform emerged from discovery of beneficial germline gene catabodies
that hydrolyzed self-proteins by transient covalent pairing of the strong
catabody nucleophile with a weak target protein electrophile. Catabodies have
evolved by Darwinian natural selection for protection against misfolded
self-proteins that threatened survival by causing amyloid disease. Ancient
antibody scaffolds upregulate the catalytic activity of the antibody variable (V)
domains. Healthy humans universally produce beneficial catabodies specific for at
least 3 misfolded self-proteins, transthyretin, amyloid β peptide and tau
protein. Catabody are superior to ordinary antibodies because of catalyst reuse
for thousands of target destruction cycles with little or no risk of causing
inflammation, a must for non-toxic removal of abundant targets such as amyloids. 
Library mining with electrophilic target analogs (ETAs) isolates therapy-grade
catabodies (fast, specific). Ex vivo- and in vivo-verified catabodies specific
for the misfolded protein are available to dissolve brain, cardiac and vertebral 
amyloids. Immunization with ETAs overcomes important ordinary vaccine limitations
(no catabody induction, poor immunogenicity of key target epitopes). We conceive 
electrophilic longevity vaccines that can induce catabody synthesis for
long-lasting protection against amyloid disease.

tissue, non-homogeneously surrounding the myocardium. Physiologically, EAT
regulates toxic fatty acids, protects the coronary arteries against mechanical
strain, regulates proinflammatory cytokines, stimulates the production of nitric 
oxide, reduces oxidative stress, and works as a thermogenic source against
hypothermia. Conversely, EAT has pathologic paracrine interactions with the
surrounded vessels, and might favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. In
addition, initial atherosclerotic lesions can promote inflammation and trigger
the EAT production of cytokines increasing vascular inflammation, which, in turn,
may help the development of collateral vessels but also of self-stimulating,
dysregulated inflammatory process, increasing coronary artery disease severity.
Variations in EAT were also linked to metabolic syndrome. Echocardiography first 
estimated EAT measuring its thickness on the free wall of the right ventricle but
does not allow accurate volumetric EAT estimates. Cardiac CT (CCT) and cardiac MR
(CMR) allow for three-dimensional EAT estimates, the former showing higher
spatial resolution and reproducibility but being limited by radiation exposure
and long segmentation times, the latter being radiation-free but limited by lower
spatial resolution and reproducibility, higher cost, and difficulties for obese
patients. EAT radiodensity at CCT could to be related to underlying metabolic
processes. The correlation between EAT and response to certain pharmacological
therapies has also been investigated, showing promising results. In the future,

These articles have shown variable results, which likely reflect a lack of

criteria and treatment algorithms, yet the distribution of factors contributing
to PAH in children differs significantly from that seen in adults. It is
necessary to understand these differences in order to appropriately tailor
therapy to the needs of the child or adolescent. An expanding array of targeted
PAH drugs are now approved for use in adults, and many of these drugs are used
""off-label"" to treat children and adolescents with PAH. Use of these novel
therapies has coincided with marked improvement in outcomes, suggesting
significant benefit. However, because most of these drugs have not been studied
in rigorous randomized, controlled trials in children, it is critical that
physicians understand their mechanisms of action, potential benefits, and safety 
profiles. Pediatric PAH outcomes have improved substantially in the modern era,
coinciding with the ""off-label"" use of targeted PAH drugs in children and

benign and malignant thyroid nodules.
Materials and methods: A sum of 306 quantitative textural features of 235 thyroid
nodules (102 malignant, 43.4%; 133 benign, 56.4%) of a total of 198 patients were
investigated using the random forest ML classifier. Feature selection and
dimension reduction were conducted using reproducibility testing and a wrapper
method. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve
(AUC) of the proposed method were compared with the histopathological or
cytopathological findings as reference methods.
Results: Of the 306 initial texture features, 284 (92.2%) showed good
reproducibility (intraclass correlation ≥0.80). The random forest classifier
accurately identified 87 out of 102 malignant thyroid nodules and 117 out of 133 
benign thyroid nodules, which is a diagnostic sensitivity of 85.2%, specificity
of 87.9%, and accuracy of 86.8%. The AUC of the model was 0.92.
Conclusions: Quantitative textural analysis of thyroid nodules using ML
classification can accurately discriminate benign and malignant thyroid nodules. 
Our findings should be validated by multicenter prospective studies using
completely independent external data.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using data from a single emergency
department of a tertiary university hospital. Information collected during triage
was used in the analysis. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were
used to predict the KTAS level.
Results: The models with the highest area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) were the random forest and XGBoost models trained on
the entire dataset (AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.917-0.925 and AUROC

models trained on the clinical data was higher than that of models trained on
text data only, but the models trained on all variables had the highest AUROC
among similar machine learning models.
Conclusions: Machine learning can robustly predict the KTAS level at triage,
which may have many possibilities for use, and the addition of text data improves
the predictive performance compared to that achieved by using structured data
alone.

perimeter and area automatically from aortic annular plane images. We propose a
method combining two deep convolutional neural networks followed by a
postprocessing step. The models were trained with 355 patients using modern deep 
learning techniques, and the method was evaluated on another 118 patients. The
method was validated against an interoperator variability study of the same 118
patients. The differences between the manually obtained aortic annulus
measurements and the automatic predictions were similar to the differences
between two independent observers (paired diff. of 3.3 ± 16.8 mm2 vs.
1.3 ± 21.1 mm2 for the area and a paired diff. of 0.6 ± 1.7 mm vs. 0.2 ± 2.5 mm
for the perimeter). The area and perimeter were used to retrieve the suggested
prosthesis sizes for the Edwards Sapien 3 and the Medtronic Evolut device
retrospectively. The automatically obtained device size selections accorded well 
with the device sizes selected by operator 1. The total analysis time from aortic
annular plane to prosthesis size was below one second. This study showed that
automated TAVI device size selection using the proposed method is fast, accurate,
and reproducible. Comparison with the interobserver variability has shown the
reliability of the strategy, and embedding this tool based on deep learning in
the preoperative planning routine has the potential to increase the efficiency
while ensuring accuracy.

essential in radiation therapy for treatment planning and evaluation.
Traditionally, physicians have contoured patient images manually, which, is
time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. This study aims to a)
investigate whether customized, deep-learning-based auto-segmentation could
overcome the limitations of manual contouring and b) compare its performance
against a typical, atlas-based auto-segmentation method organ structures in liver
cancer.
METHODS: On-contrast computer tomography image sets of 70 liver cancer patients
were used, and four OARs (heart, liver, kidney, and stomach) were manually
delineated by three experienced physicians as reference structures. Atlas and
deep learning auto-segmentations were respectively performed with MIM Maestro 6.5
(MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH) and, with a deep convolution neural network
(DCNN). The Hausdorff distance (HD) and, dice similarity coefficient (DSC),
volume overlap error (VOE), and relative volume difference (RVD) were used to
quantitatively evaluate the four different methods in the case of the reference
set of the four OAR structures.
RESULTS: The atlas-based method yielded the following average DSC and standard
deviation values (SD) for the heart, liver, right kidney, left kidney, and
stomach: 0.92 ± 0.04 (DSC ± SD), 0.93 ± 0.02, 0.86 ± 0.07, 0.85 ± 0.11, and
0.60 ± 0.13 respectively. The deep-learning-based method yielded corresponding
values for the OARs of 0.94 ± 0.01, 0.93 ± 0.01, 0.88 ± 0.03, 0.86 ± 0.03, and
0.73 ± 0.09. The segmentation results show that the deep learning framework is
superior to the atlas-based framwork except in the case of the liver.
Specifically, in the case of the stomach, the DSC, VOE, and RVD showed a maximum 
difference of 21.67, 25.11, 28.80% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that a deep learning framework could 
be used more effectively and efficiently compared to atlas-based
auto-segmentation for most OARs in human liver cancer. Extended use of the
deep-learning-based framework is anticipated for auto-segmentations of other body
sites.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31775825.pdf

of various cardiomyopathies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Parametric mapping by CMR has emerged as an important
advancement in quantification of myocardial fibrosis, increased extracellular
space, and myocardial edema. In addition, improved assessment of myocardial
function with myocardial strain assessment may provide early identification of
patients at risk and determining responsiveness to therapeutic interventions.
Novel MRI techniques and the advent of artificial intelligence may help to
uncover important mechanistic insights into the cardiomyopathic process.

for patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and
coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is known to be a powerful predictor of
cardiovascular events. Collection of CAC scores simultaneously with MPI is
unexplored.
Aim: We aimed to investigate whether automatically derived CAC scores during
myocardial perfusion imaging would further improve the diagnostic accuracy of MPI
to detect obstructive CAD.
Methods: We analyzed 150 consecutive patients without a history of coronary
revascularization with suspected obstructive CAD who were referred for 82Rb
PET/CT and available coronary angiographic data. Myocardial perfusion was
evaluated both semi quantitatively as well as quantitatively according to the
European guidelines. CAC scores were automatically derived from the low-dose
attenuation correction CT scans using previously developed software based on deep
learning. Obstructive CAD was defined as stenosis >70% (or >50% in the left main 
coronary artery) and/or fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80.
Results: In total 58% of patients had obstructive CAD of which seventy-four
percent were male. Addition of CAC scores to MPI and clinical predictors
significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of MPI to detect obstructive CAD. 
The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.87 to 0.91 (p: 0.025).
Sensitivity and specificity analysis showed an incremental decrease in false
negative tests with our MPI + CAC approach (n = 14 to n = 4), as a consequence an
increase in false positive tests was seen (n = 11 to n = 28).
Conclusion: CAC scores collected simultaneously with MPI improve the detection of
obstructive coronary artery disease in patients without a history of coronary
revascularization.

counterparts, several self-encoded damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
induce inflammatory gene expression. However, whether this symmetry in host
responses between PAMPs and DAMPs extends to metabolic shifts is unclear. Here,
we report that the self-encoded oxidized phospholipid oxPAPC alters the

lipopolysaccharide rely exclusively on glycolysis, macrophages exposed to oxPAPC 
also use mitochondrial respiration, feed the Krebs cycle with glutamine, and
favor the accumulation of oxaloacetate in the cytoplasm. This metabolite
potentiates interleukin-1β production, resulting in hyperinflammation. Similar
metabolic adaptions occur in vivo in hypercholesterolemic mice and human

with chest computed tomography images conducted between 2006 and 2018. We
classified the selected individuals into underweight (<18.5), normal weight
(≥18.5, <25), overweight (≥25, <30), and obese (≥30) groups according to BMI
(kg/m2). We defined heart compression fraction (HCF) as [Formula: see text] and
estimated under-HCF (the value of HCF <20%), and over-HCF (the residual depth
<2 cm after simulation with chest compression depth 5 and 6 cm). We compared
these outcomes between BMI groups. Of 30 342 individuals, 8856 were selected and 
classified into 4 BMI groups from a database. We randomly selected 100
individuals in each group and analyzed a total of 400 individuals' cases. Higher 
BMI groups had a significantly decreased HCF with both 5 and 6 cm depth
(P<0.001). The proportion of under-HCF with both depths increased according to

portable and wearable devices we use daily for health and fitness tracking. Its
simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical
applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias,
fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can
hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false
interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded.
Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the 
goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the
case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)-a common episodic heart arrhythmia
and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional
machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the
presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality
assessment.

of PPG signals were employed-a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D)
one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30 s PPG signals
from 13 stroke patients.

zebrafish Tg (kdrl:mCherry) and Tg (myl7:GFP) to investigate whether STS and
melatonin could reverse the cardiovascular toxicity and neurotoxicity induced by 
deltamethrin. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 25 μg/L deltamethrin at 10 hpf
and treated with 100 mmol/L STS and 1 μmol/L melatonin showed that deltamethrin
treatment affected normal cardiovascular development. In situ hybridization and
qRT-PCR results showed that deltamethrin could interfere with the normal
expression of cardiovascular development-related genes vegfr2, shh, gata4,
nkx2.5, causing functional defects in the cardiovascular system. In addition,
deltamethrin could affect the sleep-waking behavior of larvae, increasing the
activity of larvae, decreasing the rest behavior and the expression of hcrt,
hcrtr, aanat2 were down-regulated. The addition of melatonin and STS can
significantly alleviate cardiovascular toxicity and sleep-waking induced by
deltamethrin, while restoring the expression of related genes to normal levels.

and sleep-waking behavior caused by deltamethrin.

at long interventricular delay (right ventricle [RV]-LV) is strongly associated

independently evaluated, but little is known regarding the interrelationship
between these measures or of delay to the RV.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between
measures of electrical delay on CRT response in the SMART-AV (SmartDelay
Determined AV Optimization: A Comparison to Other AV Delay Methods Used in
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) trial.
METHODS: In 419 patients, QLV and RV-LV were measured. CRT response was defined
as a >15% reduction in LV end-systolic volume from implant to 6 months. The
correlation between QLV and RV-LV and the clinical variables associated with the 
difference between QLV and RV-LV (QRV) were determined. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to analyze the association between these measures on CRT
response. A machine learning algorithm was used to construct a classification
tree to predict response to CRT.
RESULTS: The cohort was 66% male (age 66 ± 11 years), 75% had left bundle branch 
block; and QRS was 150 ± 25 ms. QLV and RV-LV were highly correlated (R2 = 0.71).
A longer QRV was observed among patients with right bundle branch block, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, and increased QRS. In a multivariable model including QLV, RV-LV,
and other known predictors of CRT response, RV-LV, but not QLV, remained
associated with CRT response (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.26;
P = .017). Combining the 2 measures achieved better prediction of CRT response in
the group with intermediate RV-LV.
CONCLUSION: RV-LV is a better predictor of CRT response than QLV. There is
incremental value in using both measurements or QRV in certain subpopulations.

Auscultation of the heart is a widely studied technique, which requires precise
hearing from practitioners as a means of distinguishing subtle differences in
heart-beat rhythm. This technique is popular due to its non-invasive nature, and 
can be an early diagnosis aid for a range of cardiac conditions. Machine
listening approaches can support this process, monitoring continuously and
allowing for a representation of both mild and chronic heart conditions. Despite 
this potential, relevant databases and benchmark studies are scarce. In this
paper, we introduce our publicly accessible database, the Heart Sounds Shenzhen
Corpus (HSS), which was first released during the recent INTERSPEECH 2018 ComParE
Heart Sound sub-challenge. Additionally, we provide a survey of machine learning

thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (TAAAR) is helpful for decision-making
during the postoperative phase. To find a more efficient method for making a
prediction, we performed tests on the efficacy of different machine learning

METHODS: Perioperative TAAAR data were retrospectively collected from Beijing
Anzhen Hospital and Shanghai DeltaHealth Hospital. Operations were conducted
under normothermia using a four-branched graft. Four commonly used machine
learning classification models (ie, logistic regression, linear and Gaussian
kernel support vector machine, and random forest) were chosen to predict ARF and 
paraplegia separately. The efficacy of the models was validated by five-fold
cross-validation.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2017, 212 TAAARs were performed. ARF was identified in 27
patients, and paraplegia was found in 18 patients. Five-fold cross-validation
showed that among the four classification models, random forest was the most
precise model for predicting ARF, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of
0.89 ± 0.08. Linear support vector machine was the most precise model for
predicting paraplegia, with an average AUC of 0.89 ± 0.18. The prediction program
has been uploaded to GitHub for open access.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models can precisely predict ARF and paraplegia
during early stages after surgery. This program allows cardiac surgeons to
address complications earlier and may help improve the clinical outcomes of
TAAAR.

diseases. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores consistently underestimate
cardiovascular risk in this population. Subsets of microRNAs (miRNAs) are
differentially expressed among individuals with cardiovascular disease and
individuals infected with HIV. However, no study has clarified whether specific
miRNAs may be biomarkers for cardiovascular disease in individuals with HIV.
DESIGN/METHODS: We compared the miRNA expression profiles of 34 HIV-positive
individuals who had experienced clinically adjudicated type I myocardial
infarctions (MI) with the profiles of 76 HIV-positive controls matched by
traditional cardiovascular risk factors and HIV-specific measures. Using the
elastic net algorithm, we selected miRNAs most strongly associated with incident 
MI and then used conditional Cox proportional hazards regression and
cross-validation to evaluate miRNAs and their association with incident MI. We
evaluated whether miRNA markers would improve risk classification relative to the
Framingham Risk Score.
RESULTS: Higher miR-125a-5p and miR-139-5p expression levels were each associated
with increased risk of developing MI after adjustment for Framingham Risk Score
and HIV-related factors (hazard ratio 2.43, P = 0.018; hazard ratio 2.13,
P = 0.048, respectively). Compared with the Framingham Risk Score alone, adding
expression levels of miR-125a-5p or miR-139-5p resulted in an integrated
discrimination improvement of 10.1 or 5.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: MiR-125a-5p and miR-139-5p, transcripts known to be differentially

CONCLUSIONS: In people with T2D and low habitual sodium intake, salt

associate with the risk of cardio-metabolic diseases, but how circulating
selenium is related to dyslipidemia remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of circulating selenium levels with
lipid profiles and dyslipidemia among US adults.
METHODS: Using the data collected from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2006), we performed multivariate logistic
regression to examine the association of circulating selenium levels (in
quartiles) with total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
non-HDL-C, and atherogenic index (AI).
RESULTS: We included 2903 adults (49.3 % male) (average age: 61.9) for analysis. 
Circulating selenium had non-linear association with TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and AI
(all p < 0.05). When comparing with the lowest quartile, subjects with the
highest quartile of circulating selenium (>147.00 μg/L) had the higher odds of
elevated TG (OR: 1.75, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.68), TC (OR: 2.47, 95% CI = 1.62, 3.76), 
LDL-C (OR: 2.52, 95% CI = 1.60, 3.96), non-HDL-C (OR: 2.17, 95% CI = 1.41, 3.33),
AI (OR: 1.20, 95% CI = 0.73, 1.97) and low-HDL-C (OR: 2.10, 95% CI = 1.19, 3.72).
Similar patterns were observed in subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher circulating selenium levels had non-linear association with
lipid profiles and the increased odds of dyslipidemia.

into complex multicellular organoids that recapitulate many aspects of tissue
development. However, robustly directing morphogenesis of hPSC-derived organoids 
requires novel approaches to accurately control self-directed pattern formation. 
Here, we combined genetic engineering with computational modeling, machine
learning, and mathematical pattern optimization to create a data-driven approach 
to control hPSC self-organization by knock down of genes previously shown to
affect stem cell colony organization, CDH1 and ROCK1. Computational replication
of the in vitro system in silico using an extended cellular Potts model enabled
machine learning-driven optimization of parameters that yielded emergence of
desired patterns. Furthermore, in vitro the predicted experimental parameters
quantitatively recapitulated the in silico patterns. These results demonstrate
that morphogenic dynamics can be accurately predicted through model-driven
exploration of hPSC behaviors via machine learning, thereby enabling spatial

self-monitoring dispensed through mobile apps, have been shown to improve blood
pressure, but the results vary and long-term engagement is a challenge. Machine
learning is a rapidly advancing discipline that can be used to generate
predictive and responsive models for the management and treatment of chronic
conditions and shows potential for meaningfully improving outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this retrospective analysis were to examine the
effect of a novel digital therapeutic on blood pressure in adults with
hypertension and to explore the ability of machine learning to predict
participant completion of the intervention.
METHODS: Participants with hypertension, who engaged with the digital
intervention for at least 2 weeks and had paired blood pressure values, were
identified from the intervention database. Participants were required to be ≥18
years old, reside in the United States, and own a smartphone. The digital
intervention offers personalized behavior therapy, including goal setting, skill 
building, and self-monitoring. Participants reported blood pressure values at
will, and changes were calculated using averages of baseline and final values for
each participant. Machine learning was used to generate a model of participants
who would complete the intervention. Random forest models were trained at days 1,
3, and 7 of the intervention, and the generalizability of the models was assessed
using leave-one-out cross-validation.
RESULTS: The primary cohort comprised 172 participants with hypertension, having 
paired blood pressure values, who were engaged with the intervention. Of the
total, 86.1% participants were women, the mean age was 55.0 years (95% CI
53.7-56.2), baseline systolic blood pressure was 138.9 mmHg (95% CI 136.6-141.3),
and diastolic was 86.2 mmHg (95% CI 84.8-87.7). Mean change was -11.5 mmHg for
systolic blood pressure and -5.9 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure over a mean of
62.6 days (P<.001). Among participants with stage 2 hypertension, mean change was
-17.6 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -8.8 mmHg for diastolic blood
pressure. Changes in blood pressure remained significant in a mixed-effects model
accounting for the baseline systolic blood pressure, age, gender, and body mass
index (P<.001). A total of 43% of the participants tracking their blood pressure 
at 12 weeks achieved the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association definition of blood pressure control. The 7-day predictive model for 
intervention completion was trained on 427 participants, and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve was .78.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in blood pressure were observed in adults with
hypertension who used the digital therapeutic. The degree of blood pressure
reduction was clinically meaningful and achieved rapidly by a majority of the
studied participants. Greater improvement was observed in participants with more 
severe hypertension at baseline. A successful proof of concept for using machine 
learning to predict intervention completion was presented.

In addition to coronary artery abnormalities, aneurysms and myocarditis, acute KD
is also associated with echocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in 40-80% of patients.
Here, we show that these ECG changes are recapitulated in the Lactobacillus casei
cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced KD vasculitis mouse model. LCWE-injected mice
developed elevated heart rate and decreased R wave amplitude, with significant
differences in prolonged ventricular repolarization. LCWE-injected mice developed
cardiac ganglion inflammation, that may affect the impulse-conducting system in
the myocardium. Furthermore, serum nerve growth factor (NGF) was significantly
elevated in LCWE-injected mice, similar to children with KD vasculitis,
associated with increased neural remodeling of the myocardium. ECG abnormalities 
were prevented by blocking interleukin (IL)-1 signaling with anakinra, and the
increase in serum NGF and cardiac neural remodeling were similarly blocked in
Il1r1-/- mice and in wild-type mice treated with anakinra. Thus, similar to
clinical KD, the LCWE-induced KD vasculitis mouse model also exhibits
electrophysiological abnormalities and cardiac neuronal remodeling, and these
changes can be prevented by blocking IL-1 signaling. These data support the
acceleration of anti-IL-1 therapy trials to benefit KD patients.

strong genetic background. The aim of this study was to uncover genetic factors
underlying lean mass development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of
fat-adjusted leg lean mass in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, N = 6587), and
replicated in the Women's Health Initiative-African American sub-sample (WHI-AA, 
N = 847) and the Kansas City Osteoporosis Study (KCOS, N = 2219). We also
cross-validated significant variants in the publicly available body mass index
(BMI) summary results (N ~ 700,000). We then performed a series of functional
investigations on the identified variants.
RESULTS: Four correlated SNPs at 6p21.1 were identified at the genome-wide
significance (GWS, α = 5.0 × 10-8) level in the discovery FHS sample (rs551145,
rs524533, rs571770, and rs545970, p = 3.40-9.77 × 10-9), and were successfully
replicated in both the WHI-AA and the KCOS samples (one-sided
p = 1.61 × 10-3-0.04). They were further cross-validated by the large-scale BMI
summary results (p = 7.0-9.8 × 10-3). Cis-eQTL analyses associated these SNPs
with the NFKBIE gene expression. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) in
mouse C2C12 myoblast cells implied that rs524533 and rs571770 were bound to an
unknown transcription factor in an allelic specific manner, while rs551145 and
rs545970 did not. Dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that both rs524533 and 
rs571770 downregulated luciferase expression by repressing promoter activity.
Moreover, the regulation pattern was allelic specific, strengthening the evidence
towards their differential regulatory effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale GWAS followed by a series of functional
investigations, we identified 2 correlated functional variants at 6p21.1
associated with leg lean mass. Our findings not only enhanced our understanding
of molecular basis of lean mass development but also provided useful candidate
genes for further functional studies.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31757224.pdf

in patients with left ventricular assist devices. Although AI may be commonly
assessed by echocardiography, expert techniques are required for accurate
quantification of AI severity.
DESCRIPTION: In this prospective blinded study, screenshots from the HVAD display
and simultaneous echocardiographic measurements were obtained. Each screenshot
was digitized and the early-diastolic phase slope was calculated, and blinded to 
the echocardiographic results. The regurgitant fraction of AI was quantified by
novel Doppler echocardiography of outflow graft.
EVALUATION: Thirty patients (median 57 years old, 57% male) were enrolled. A
cutoff of -17.6 L/min/sec for early-diastolic phase slope had a sensitivity 0.92 
and a specificity 0.53 to estimate significant AI with regurgitant fraction ≥30% 
and significantly stratified patients into a low regurgitant faction group (0.3%)
and a high regurgitant fraction group (33.0%) (p = 0.009). Early-diastolic phase 
slope had a moderate correlation with actually measured regurgitant fraction (r =
0.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Early-diastolic phase slope of the HVAD flow waveform might be a
novel parameter that can estimate the presence of clinically significant AI.

considered relatively straightforward. Recently, however, there is increasing
awareness that within this single clinical phenotype exists considerable
heterogeneity: disease onset spans the complete age range; genetic susceptibility
is complex; rates of progression differ markedly, as does insulin secretory
capacity; and complication rates, glycemic control, and therapeutic intervention 
efficacy vary widely. Mechanistic and immunopathological studies typically show
considerable patchiness across subjects, undermining conclusions regarding
disease pathways. Without better understanding, type 1 diabetes heterogeneity
represents a major barrier both to deciphering pathogenesis and to the
translational effort of designing, conducting, and interpreting clinical trials
of disease-modifying agents. This realization comes during a period of
unprecedented change in clinical medicine, with increasing emphasis on greater
individualization and precision. For complex disorders such as type 1 diabetes,
the option of maintaining the ""single disease"" approach appears untenable, as
does the notion of individualizing each single patient's care, obliging us to
conceptualize type 1 diabetes less in terms of phenotypes (observable
characteristics) and more in terms of disease endotypes (underlying biological
mechanisms). Here, we provide our view on an approach to dissect heterogeneity in
type 1 diabetes. Using lessons from other diseases and the data gathered to date,
we aim to delineate a roadmap through which the field can incorporate the
endotype concept into laboratory and clinical practice. We predict that such an
effort will accelerate the implementation of precision medicine and has the
potential for impact on our approach to translational research, trial design, and
clinical management.

dog-walking behaviour. We examined associations between neighbourhood built
environment attributes and dog-ownership and dog-walking behaviour in Japan. Data
from 1058 participants were used. The dog-ownership was 18.8%. All neighbourhood 
built attributes (excluding availability of parks) were negatively associated
with dog-ownership. Among dog-owners, these same attributes were positively
associated with any dog-walking in a usual week and with achieving 150-min per
week of physical activity through dog-walking alone. These findings provided
evidence on the importance of neighbourhood built environment attributes on
dog-ownership and dog-walking behaviour in dense and compact areas. The urban
design and public health implication of these findings is that the built
environment attributes in high-density living areas may have different impacts on
dog-ownership and dog-walking: while living in a walkable neighbourhood may not
be conducive to dog-ownership, it may support dog-walking in such areas. Programs
targeting dog-owners in high-density areas might be needed to encourage them to
walk their dogs more. If successful, these programs could contribute to higher
physical activity levels among dog-owners.

care medicine and emergency medicine. Thus, even small differences in outcome may
have major implications, and therefore, the choice between balanced crystalloids 
versus normal saline continues to be debated. We examined to what extent the
currently accrued information size from completed and ongoing trials on the
subject allow intensivists and emergency physicians to choose the right fluid for
their patients.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis with random effects inverse variance
model. Published randomized controlled trials enrolling adult patients to compare
balanced crystalloids versus normal saline in the setting of intensive care
medicine or emergency medicine were included. The main outcome was mortality at
the longest follow-up, and secondary outcomes were moderate to severe acute
kidney injury (AKI) and initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Trial
sequential analyses (TSA) were performed, and risk of bias and overall quality of
evidence were assessed. Additionally, previously published meta-analyses, trial
sequential analyses and ongoing large trials were analysed for included studies, 
required information size calculations and the assumptions underlying those
calculations.
RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 32,777) were included. Of those, eight had data
available on mortality, seven on AKI and six on RRT. Meta-analysis showed no
significant differences between balanced crystalloids versus normal saline for
mortality (P = 0.33), the incidence of moderate to severe AKI (P = 0.37) or
initiation of RRT (P = 0.29). Quality of evidence was low to very low. Analysis
of previous meta-analyses and ongoing trials showed large differences in
calculated required versus accrued information sizes and assumptions underlying
those. TSA revealed the need for extremely large trials based on our realistic
and clinically relevant assumptions on relative risk reduction and baseline
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis could not find significant differences between
balanced crystalloids and normal saline on mortality at the longest follow-up,
moderate to severe AKI or new RRT. Currently accrued information size is smaller,
and the required information size is larger than previously anticipated.
Therefore, completed and ongoing trials on the topic may fail to provide adequate
guidance for choosing the right crystalloid. Thus, physiology will continue to
play an important role for individualizing this choice.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31752973.pdf

(BRG1) deficiency and undifferentiated round cell or rhabdoid morphology have
been recently described and proposed to represent thoracic sarcomas. However, it 
remains unclear whether such tumors may instead represent sarcomatoid carcinomas,
and how their clinicopathologic characteristics compare with those of
nonsarcomatoid SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung carcinomas (SD-NSCC).
METHODS: We identified 22 SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomatoid tumors (SD-TSTs)
with round cell and/or rhabdoid morphology and 45 SD-NSCCs, and comprehensively
analyzed their clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genomic
characteristics using 341-468 gene next-generation sequencing and other molecular
platforms.
RESULTS: The relationship of SD-TSTs with NSCC was supported by (1) the presence 
of NSCC components juxtaposed with sarcomatoid areas in five cases, (2) focal
expression of NSCC lineage markers TTF1 or p40 in four additional cases, (3)
smoking history in all except one patient (mean = 51 pack-years), accompanied by 
genomic smoking signature, and (4) high tumor mutation burden (mean = 14.2
mutations per megabase) and mutations characteristic of NSCC in a subset.
Compared with SD-NSCCs, SD-TSTs exhibited considerably larger primary tumor size 
(p < 0.0001), worse survival (p = 0.004), and more frequent presentation at
younger age (30-50 years) despite heavier smoking history. Distinctive pathologic
features of SD-TSTs included consistent lack of adhesion molecule claudin-4,
SMARCA2 (BRM) codeficiency, and frequent expression of stem cell markers.
CONCLUSIONS: SD-TSTs represent primarily smoking-associated
undifferentiated/de-differentiated carcinomas rather than primary thoracic
sarcomas. Despite their histogenetic relationship with NSCC, these tumors have
unique clinicopathologic characteristics, supporting their recognition as a
distinct entity. Further studies are warranted to determine therapeutic
approaches to this novel class of exceptionally aggressive thoracic tumors.

heart failure (HF). Sinoatrial node (SAN) adenosine A1 receptors (ADO A1Rs) are
upregulated in HF, and adenosine is known to exert negative chronotropic effects 
on the SAN. Here, we investigated the role of A1R signaling at physiologically
relevant ADO concentrations on HF SAN pacemaker cells.
MAIN METHODS: Dogs with tachypacing-induced chronic HF and normal controls (CTL) 
were studied. SAN tissue was collected for A1R and GIRK mRNA quantification. SAN 
cells were isolated for perforated patch clamp recordings and firing rate (bpm), 
slope of slow diastolic depolarization (SDD), and maximum diastolic potential
(MDP) were measured. Action potentials (APs) and currents were recorded before
and after addition of 1 and 10 μM ADO. To assess contributions of A1R and G
protein-coupled Inward Rectifier Potassium Current (GIRK) to ADO effects, APs
were measured after the addition of DPCPX (selective A1R antagonist) or TPQ
(selective GIRK blocker).
KEY FINDINGS: A1R and GIRK mRNA expression were significantly increased in HF. In
addition, ADO induced greater rate slowing and membrane hyperpolarization in HF
vs CTL (p < 0.05). DPCPX prevented ADO-induced rate slowing in CTL and HF cells. 
The ADO-induced inward rectifying current, IKado, was observed significantly more
frequently in HF than in CTL. TPQ prevented ADO-induced rate slowing in HF.
SIGNIFICANCE: An increase in A1R and GIRK expression enhances IKAdo, causing
hyperpolarization, and subsequent negative chronotropic effects in canine chronic
HF at relevant [ADO]. GIRK blockade may be a useful strategy to mitigate
bradycardia in HF.

still a concern. This study aimed to compare the lesion characteristics and
tissue temperature profiles between 20 W (20 Ws) and 40 W (40 Ws) ablation
settings under the same AI and LSI.
METHODS: An ex vivo model consisting of swine myocardium (5-6 mm thickness) in a 
circulating, warmed saline bath was used. Twenty-one tissue temperature
electrodes were used. Radiofrequency applications with different power settings
were performed with a 10 to 12 g contact force until the AI and LSI reached 350
and 4.5, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 120 radiofrequency (RF) applications and 2520 tissue
temperature profiles were analyzed. The speed of the tissue temperature rise with
40 Ws was significantly faster than that with 20 Ws. However, the maximum tissue 
temperature did not significantly differ between 20 and 40 Ws with the same AI
(44.6°C ± 3.9°C vs 45.1°C ± 6.4°C, P = .73), and was significantly lower for
40 Ws with the same LSI (42.8°C ± 3.4°C vs 40.0°C ± 3.4°C, P = .003). For both
the AI and LSI, the number of electrodes exhibiting high temperatures (≥39°C) was
significantly larger and the duration of high tissue temperatures was
significantly longer with 20 Ws. The thermal latency with 40 Ws was greater.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the targeted AI and LSI were the same for both 20 and
40 Ws, the tissue temperature profiles differed greatly depending on the RF power
setting. A high power setting based on the AI and LSI may reduce the collateral
thermal damage.

and outcomes. The growth of biobanks linked to electronic medical record (EMR)
data has both facilitated and increased the demand for efficient, accurate, and
robust approaches for phenotyping millions of patients. Challenges to phenotyping
with EMR data include variation in the accuracy of codes, as well as the high
level of manual input required to identify features for the algorithm and to
obtain gold standard labels. To address these challenges, we developed PheCAP, a 
high-throughput semi-supervised phenotyping pipeline. PheCAP begins with data
from the EMR, including structured data and information extracted from the
narrative notes using natural language processing (NLP). The standardized steps
integrate automated procedures, which reduce the level of manual input, and
machine learning approaches for algorithm training. PheCAP itself can be executed
in 1-2 d if all data are available; however, the timing is largely dependent on
the chart review stage, which typically requires at least 2 weeks. The final
products of PheCAP include a phenotype algorithm, the probability of the
phenotype for all patients, and a phenotype classification (yes or no).",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31748751.pdf

personality is the integrated expression of three major systems of learning and
memory that regulate (1) associative conditioning, (2) intentionality, and (3)
self-awareness. We have uncovered largely disjoint sets of genes regulating these
dissociable learning processes in different clusters of people with (1)
unregulated temperament profiles (i.e., associatively conditioned habits and
emotional reactivity), (2) organized character profiles (i.e., intentional
self-control of emotional conflicts and goals), and (3) creative character
profiles (i.e., self-aware appraisal of values and theories), respectively.
However, little is known about how these temperament and character components of 
personality are jointly organized and develop in an integrated manner. In three
large independent genome-wide association studies from Finland, Germany, and
Korea, we used a data-driven machine learning method to uncover joint phenotypic 
networks of temperament and character and also the genetic networks with which
they are associated. We found three clusters of similar numbers of people with
distinct combinations of temperament and character profiles. Their associated
genetic and environmental networks were largely disjoint, and differentially
related to distinct forms of learning and memory. Of the 972 genes that mapped to
the three phenotypic networks, 72% were unique to a single network. The findings 
in the Finnish discovery sample were blindly and independently replicated in
samples of Germans and Koreans. We conclude that temperament and character are
integrated within three disjoint networks that regulate healthy longevity and
dissociable systems of learning and memory by nearly disjoint sets of genetic and
environmental influences.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31748689.pdf

BACKGROUND: Portable noninvasive Heart Rate Complexity (HRC) and Compensatory
Reserve Measurement (CRM) monitors have been developed to triage supine combat
casualties. Neither monitor has been tested in upright individuals during
physical exercise. This study tests the hypothesis that exercise evokes
proportional changes in HRC and CRM.METHODS: Two instruments monitored volunteers
(9 civilian and 11 soldiers) from the Army Trauma Training Department (ATTD)
before, during, and following physical exercise. One recorded heart rate (HR,
bpm), cardiac output (CO, L · min-1), heart rate variability (HRV, root mean
square of successive differences, ms), and HRC (Sample Entropy, unitless). The
other recorded HR, pulse oximetry (Spo₂, %), and CRM (%).RESULTS: Baseline HR,
CO, HRV, HRC, and CRM averaged 72 ± 1 bpm, 5.6 ± 1.2 L · min-1, 48 ± 24 ms, 1.9 ±
0.5, and 85 ± 10% in seated individuals. Exercise evoked peak HR and CO at > 200%
of baseline, while HRC and CRM were simultaneously decreased to minimums that
were ≤ 50% of baseline (all P < 0.001). HRV changes were variable and unreliable.
Spo₂ remained consistently above 95%. During a 60 min recovery, HR and CRM
returned to baseline on parallel tracks (t1/2=11 ± 8 and 18 ± 14 min), whereas
HRC recovery was slower than either CRM or HR (t1/2=40 ± 18 min, both P <
0.05).DISCUSSION: Exercise evoked qualitatively similar changes in CRM and HRC.
CRM recovered incrementally faster than HRC, suggesting that vasodilation, muscle
pump, and respiration compensate faster than cardiac autonomic control in young, 
healthy volunteers. Both HRC and CRM appear to provide reliable, objective, and
noninvasive metrics of human performance in upright exercising individuals.Mulder

organizing brain processes because it provides a recurrent temporal frame for
information coding. However, the low-frequency cortical phase exhibits great
flexibility in response to external influences. Given that brain rhythms have
been found to track respiratory inputs, we hypothesized that slow breathing,
commonly associated with mental regulation, could reorganize the relationship
between these two rhythmic systems through the adjustment of the cortical phase
to such a slow train of inputs. Based on simultaneous magnetoencephalography and 
respiratory measurements, we report that while participants performed paced
breathing, slow relative to normal breathing modulated cortical phase activity in
the alpha range across widespread brain areas. Such modulation effects were
specifically locked to the middle of the inspiration stage and exhibited a
well-structured pattern. At the single-subject level, the phase angles underlying
the effects became more likely to be diametrically opposed across breaths,
indicating unique and consistent phase adjustment to slow inspiratory inputs.
Neither cardiac fluctuations nor breathing-unrelated task effects could account
for the findings. We suggest that slow-paced inspiration could organize the
cortical phase in a regularized phase pattern, revealing a rhythmic but dynamic
neural network integrated with different neurophysiological systems through
volitional control.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Breathing is more complicated than a simple
gas exchange, as it is integrated with numerous cognitive and emotional
functions. Controlled slow breathing has often been used to regulate mental
processes. This magnetoencephalography study demonstrates that slow-paced
relative to normal-paced inspiration could organize the timing of alpha rhythmic 
activities across breathing cycles in a structured manner over widespread brain
areas. Our results reveal how a volitionally controlled change in respiratory
behavior could systematically modulate cortical activity.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31747328.pdf

of an innovative electrophysiological sensor that can be used in greenhouse

measurements. The bioelectrical activity is modified in response to water stress 
conditions or to nycthemeral rhythm. Furthermore, the automatic classification of

ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve the
computational annotation of protein function.
RESULTS: Here, we report on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that 
featured an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms of
volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed. In a novel and major
new development, computational predictions and assessment goals drove some of the
experimental assays, resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000
genes. Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation screening in
Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes, which provided us with
genome-wide experimental data for genes associated with biofilm formation and
motility. We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in Drosophila
melanogaster, which we suspected of being involved in long-term memory.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that while predictions of the molecular function and
biological process annotations have slightly improved over time, those of the
cellular component have not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations 
remains equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods is
significantly better than the expectations set by baseline methods in C. albicans
and D. melanogaster, it leaves considerable room and need for improvement.
Finally, we report that the CAFA community now involves a broad range of
participants with expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation,
biocuration, and bio-ontologies, working together to improve functional
annotation, computational function prediction, and our ability to manage big data

peptide (NT-proBNP) on all-cause mortality in heart failure patients with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) at real world scenarios. Methods: Patients
who met the diagnostic criteria of HFpEF in the China National Heart Failure
Registration Study (CN-HF) were divided into death and survival groups. The
demographic data, physical examination, results of the first echocardiography,
laboratory results at admission, complications, drug use and clinical outcomes
were obtained from CN-HF. The univariate Cox proportional hazard model was used
to screen the variates that might predict prognosis, and then the covariates with
statistical significance were included in the multivariate Cox regression model
to analyze the predictive value of baseline NT-proBNP on all-cause death.
Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between
NT-proBNP and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), so as to further
explore the predictive value of the interaction between renal dysfunction and
NT-proBNP on death. Since NT-proBNP did not obey the binary normal distribution, 
it was expressed by the natural logarithm of NT-proBNP (LnNT-proBNP). Results: A 
total of 1 846 HFpEF patients were enrolled in this study, with an average age of
71.5 years, 1 017 males(55.1%), median NT-proBNP 860 ng/L, and median eGFR 73.9
ml·min-1·1.73m-2. After a median follow-up of 34 months, 213 (11.5%) patients
died. Patients in the death group were older, with higher NYHA classification Ⅲ-Ⅳ
ratio, longer hospital stay, higher serum potassium and NT-proBNP level,
prevalence of complications of diabetes mellitus, arrhythmia and atrial
fibrillation, use of angiotensin receptor antagonist(ARB), mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists (MRA), diuretic and digoxin was significantly higher in
death group than in survival group. Body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood
pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), hemoglobin, serum
cholesterol(TC), serum triglycerides (TG) and eGFR, and use of angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), statins and aspirin were lower in death
group than in survival group. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that
NT-proBNP was a predictor of all-cause death in HFpEF patients (HR=2.522, 95%CI
2.040-3.119, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the
elevated NT-proBNP remains as the independent predictor of all-cause death in
patients with HFpEF (HR=1.230, 95%CI 1.049-1.442, P=0.011) after adjusting for
age, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, LVEF, hemoglobin, serum potassium, serum
sodium, TC, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), TG, eGFR, atrial 
fibrillation, as well as the treatment of ACEI/ARB, MRA, diuretics and digoxin.
Spearman correlation analysis showed that LnNT-proBNP was negatively correlated
with eGFR (r=-0.361, P<0.001), but there was no interaction between NT-proBNP and
renal dysfunction in predicting death in HFpEF patients (P>0.05). Conclusion: The
elevated level of NT-proBNP at admission is an independent predictor of all-cause
mortality in HFpEF patients.

BACKGROUND: Ceramides are sphingolipids that play causative roles in diabetes and
heart disease, with their serum levels measured clinically as biomarkers of
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We performed targeted lipidomics on serum samples of individuals with
familial coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 462) and population-based controls (n
= 212) to explore the relationship between serum sphingolipids and CAD, employing
unbiased machine learning to identify sphingolipid species positively associated 
with CAD.
RESULTS: Nearly every sphingolipid measured (n = 30 of 32) was significantly
elevated in subjects with CAD compared with population controls. We generated a
novel Sphingolipid Inclusive CAD risk score, termed SIC, that demarcates CAD
patients independently and more effectively than conventional clinical CVD
biomarkers including LDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides. This new metric
comprises several minor lipids which likely serve as measures of flux through the
ceramide biosynthesis pathway, rather than the abundant deleterious ceramide
species that are incorporated in other ceramide-based scores.
CONCLUSION: This study validates serum ceramides as candidate biomarkers of
cardiovascular disease and suggests that comprehensive sphingolipid panels be
considered as measures of CVD.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31743112,Nan

inflammatory states and has been applied in the clinic for liver dysfunction,
heart disease, and diabetes. With the notable exception of antibodies, the liver 
produces most of the circulatory glycoproteins, including the acute phase
proteins released as a function of the inflammatory response. Among these
proteins is β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal1), an enzyme required
for α2,6-linked sialylation of glycoproteins. Here, we describe a
hepatocyte-specific conditional knockout of ST6Gal1 (H-cKO) using albumin
promoter-driven Cre-lox recombination. We confirm the loss of circulatory
glycoprotein α2,6 sialylation and note no obvious dysfunction or pathology in
young H-cKO mice, yet these mice show robust changes in plasma glycoprotein
fucosylation, branching, and the abundance of bisecting GlcNAc and marked changes
in a number of metabolic pathways. As H-cKO mice aged, they spontaneously
developed fatty liver disease characterized by the buildup of fat droplets in the
liver, inflammatory cytokine production, and a shift in liver leukocyte phenotype
away from anti-inflammatory Kupffer cells and towards pro-inflammatory M1
macrophages. These findings connect hepatocyte and circulatory glycoprotein
sialylation to the regulation of metabolism and inflammation, potentially
identifying the glycome as a new target for liver-driven disease.

computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fundamentally
depends on a definition of image similarity. Previous methods that derived
modality-invariant representations focused on either global statistical grayscale
relations or local structural similarity, both of which are prone to local
optima. In contrast to most learning-based methods that rely on strong
supervision of aligned multimodal image pairs, we aim to overcome this limitation
for further practical use cases.
METHODS: We propose a new concept that exploits anatomical shape information and 
requires only segmentation labels for both modalities individually. First, a
shape-constrained encoder-decoder segmentation network without skip connections
is jointly trained on labeled CT and MRI inputs. Second, an iterative
energy-based minimization scheme is introduced that relies on the capability of
the network to generate intermediate nonlinear shape representations. This
further eases the multimodal alignment in the case of large deformations.
RESULTS: Our novel approach robustly and accurately aligns 3D scans from the
multimodal whole-heart segmentation dataset, outperforming classical unsupervised
frameworks. Since both parts of our method rely on (stochastic) gradient
optimization, it can be easily integrated in deep learning frameworks and
executed on GPUs.

(Rosaceae) are commonly used in folk medicine for their diuretic properties to
treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. To date, no scientific data has 
been published to support the diuretic potential.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and
mechanism underlying the hypotensive and diuretic action of C. songarica in
normotensive rats and to determine the constituents from the extracts by
LC-DAD-MS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, phytochemical profiling and antioxidant potential
of C. songarica extracts was determined. Then, to evaluate changes in blood
pressure, different groups of anesthetized normotensive rats were intravenously
treated with crude extract (CS-Cr, 10-80 mg/kg), aqueous soluble (AS-CS,
0.1-20 mg/kg), and n-butanol soluble fractions of C. songarica (BS-CS,
1-80 mg/kg). The diuretic effects of CS-Cr (100-500 mg/kg, p.o), AS-CS
(100-300 mg/kg, p.o) and BS-CS (100-300 mg/kg, p.o) were evaluated in comparison 
with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 10 mg/kg, p.o). The urinary volume, sodium,
potassium and pH were estimated in the sample collected for 6 h from
saline-loaded rats. Using pharmacological antagonists or inhibitors, we determine
the involvement of acetylcholine, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide in C.
songarica induced hypotensive and diuresis action. In addition, the activities of
angiotensin converting enzyme, erythrocytary carbonic anhydrase and renal
Na+/K+/ATPase were evaluated in vitro.
RESULTS: From the LC-DAD-MS analyses, thirty-nine compounds were detected,
showing a complex chemical profile and an expressive antioxidant activity ""in
vitro"". Acute treatment with CS-Cr, AS-CS, and BS-CS exhibited significant
hypotensive and diuretic potential in normotensive rats. However, AS-CS produced 
most potent and significant dose-dependent hypotension in normotensive rats, and 
also produced highly significant diuretic and saluretic effects. Despite the
changes in urinary excretion of electrolytes, the plasmatic levels of sodium and 
potassium were not changed. Previous treatment with atropine and L-NAME
significantly reduced the hypotensive and diuretic action of AS-CS in
normotensive rats. Moreover, the 7-day treatment with AS-CS also resulted in
significant ACE inhibitory activity.
CONCLUSION: This research supports and extends the ethnomedicinal use of C.
songarica as diuretic and hypotensive agent. The results showed that AS-CS from
C. songarica could present compounds responsible for hypotensive and diuretic

with advanced heart failure, but little is known about the role of neurohormonal 
blockade (NHB) in treating these patients.
Objective: To analyze the association between NHB blockade and outcomes in
patients with LVADs.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis of the
Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS)
included patients from more than 170 centers across the United States and Canada 
with continuous flow LVADs from 2008 to 2016 who were alive with the device in
place at 6 months after implant. The data were analyzed between February and
November 2019.
Exposures: Patients were stratified based on exposure to NHB and represented all 
permutations of the following drug classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid
antagonists.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were survival at 4 years and
quality of life at 2 years based on Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
scores and a 6-minute walk test.
Results: A total of 12 144 patients in INTERMACS met inclusion criteria, of whom 
2526 (20.8% ) were women, 8088 (66.6%) were white, 3024 (24.9%) were African
American, and 753 (6.2%) were Hispanic; the mean (SD) age was 56.8 (12.9) years. 
Of these, 10 419 (85.8%) were receiving NHB. Those receiving any NHB medication
at 6 months had a better survival rate at 4 years compared with patients not
receiving NHB (56.0%; 95% CI, 54.5%-57.5% vs 43.9%; 95% CI, 40.5%-47.7%). After
sensitivity analyses with an adjusted model, this trend persisted with patients
receiving triple therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blocker, β-blocker, and mineralocorticoid antagonist having 
the lowest hazard of death compared with patients in the other groups (hazard
ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.28-0.41). Compared with patients not receiving NHB, use of
NHB was associated with a higher Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score
(66.6; bootstrapped 95% CI, 65.8-67.3 vs 63.0; bootstrapped 95% CI, 60.1-65.8;
P = .02) and a 6-minute walk test (1103 ft; bootstrapped 95% CI, 1084-1123 ft vs 
987 ft; bootstrapped 95% CI, 913-1060 ft; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with LVADs who tolerated NHB therapy,
continued treatment was associated with improved survival and quality of life.

glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans, and is essential for maintaining the
integrity and function of biological tissues. Imaging and biomolecular
characterization of the ECM is critical for understanding disease onset and for
the development of novel, disease-modifying therapeutics. Recently, there has
been a growing interest in the use of Raman spectroscopy to characterize the ECM.
Raman spectroscopy is a label-free vibrational technique that offers unique
insights into the structure and composition of tissues and cells at the molecular
level. This technique can be applied across a broad range of ECM imaging
applications, which encompass in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo analysis.
State-of-the-art confocal Raman microscopy imaging now enables label-free
assessments of the ECM structure and composition in tissue sections with a
remarkably high degree of biomolecular specificity. Further, novel fiber-optic
instrumentation has opened up for clinical in vivo ECM diagnostic measurements
across a range of tissue systems. A palette of advanced computational methods
based on multivariate statistics, spectral unmixing, and machine learning can be 
applied to Raman data, allowing for the extraction of specific biochemical
information of the ECM. Here, we review Raman spectroscopy techniques for ECM
characterizations over a variety of exciting applications and tissue systems,
including native tissue assessments (bone, cartilage, cardiovascular),
regenerative medicine quality assessments, and diagnostics of disease states. We 
further discuss the challenges in the widespread adoption of Raman spectroscopy
in biomedicine. The results of the latest discovery-driven Raman studies are
summarized, illustrating the current and potential future applications of Raman
spectroscopy in biomedicine.

Non-invasive monitoring of stroke can be accomplished via stenosis measurements. 
The current conventional image-based methods for these measurements are not
accurate and reliable. They do not incorporate shape and intelligent learning
component in their design.
Methods: In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based methodology for
accurate measurement of stenosis in common carotid artery (CCA) ultrasound (US)
scans using a class of AtheroEdge system from AtheroPoint, USA. Three
radiologists manually traced the lumen-intima (LI) for the near and the far
walls, respectively, which served as a gold standard (GS) for training the
DL-based model. Three DL-based systems were developed based on three types of GS.
Results: IRB approved (Toho University, Japan) 407 US scans from 204 patients
were collected. The risk was characterized into three classes: low, moderate, and
high-risk. The area-under-curve (AUC) corresponding to three DL systems using
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis computed were: 0.90, 0.94 and
0.86, respectively.
Conclusions: Novel DL-based strategy showed reliable, accurate and stable
stenosis severity index (SSI) measurements.

integration of carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes (CUSIP) with
conventional risk factors (CRF) have shown improved risk stratification compared 
with either method. However such approaches have not yet leveraged the potential 
of machine learning (ML). Most intelligent ML strategies use follow-ups for the
endpoints but are costly and time-intensive. We introduce an integrated ML system
using stenosis as an endpoint for training and determine whether such a system
can lead to superior performance compared with the conventional ML system.
Methods: The ML-based algorithm consists of an offline and online system. The
offline system extracts 47 features which comprised of 13 CRF and 34 CUSIP.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select the most significant
features. These offline features were then trained using the event-equivalent
gold standard (consisting of percentage stenosis) using a random forest (RF)
classifier framework to generate training coefficients. The online system then
transforms the PCA-based test features using offline trained coefficients to
predict the risk labels on test subjects. The above ML system determines the area
under the curve (AUC) using a 10-fold cross-validation paradigm. The above system
so-called ""AtheroRisk-Integrated"" was compared against ""AtheroRisk-Conventional"",
where only 13 CRF were considered in a feature set.
Results: Left and right common carotid arteries of 202 Japanese patients (Toho
University, Japan) were retrospectively examined to obtain 395 ultrasound scans. 
AtheroRisk-Integrated system [AUC =0.80, P<0.0001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.77 to 0.84] showed an improvement of ~18% against AtheroRisk-Conventional ML
(AUC =0.68, P<0.0001, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.72).
Conclusions: ML-based integrated model with the event-equivalent gold standard as
percentage stenosis is powerful and offers low cost and high performance

patient goals and preferences associated with GDMT are not available.
Objective: To survey patients with chronic HF to better understand their
experiences and perceptions of living with HF, including their familiarity and
concerns with important GDMT therapies.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Study participants were recruited from the GfK
KnowledgePanel, a probability-sampled online panel representative of the US adult
population. English-speaking adults who met the following criteria were eligible 
if they were (1) previously told by a physician that they had HF; (2) currently
taking medications for HF; and (3) had no history of left ventricular assist
device or cardiac transplant. Data were collected between October and November
2018. Analysis began in December 2018.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The survey included 4 primary domains: (1) relative
importance of disease-related goals, (2) challenges associated with living with
HF, (3) decision-making process associated with HF medication use, and (4)
awareness and concerns about available HF medications.
Results: Of 30 707 KnowledgePanel members who received the initial survey, 15 091
(49.1%) completed the screening questions, 440 were eligible and began the
survey, and 429 completed the survey. The median (interquartile range) age was 68
(60-75) years and most were white (320 [74.6%]), male (304 [70.9%]), and had at
least a high school education (409 [95.3%]). Most survey responders reported
familiarity with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. Overall, 107 (24.9%) reported

that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coexistent coronary artery disease. Several new
glucose-lowering agents have been found to lower BP as well, making the
interaction between BP and T2DM even more complex.
METHODS: With the reference to recent literature, this review article describes
the potential mechanisms of increased risk of hypertension in T2DM and outlines
the possible optimal BP levels based upon recommendations on the management of
hypertension by the current guidelines, in combination with our research
findings, for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.
RESULTS: The development of hypertension in T2DM involves multiple processes,
including enhanced sympathetic output, inappropriate activation of
renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction induced through
insulin resistance, and abnormal sodium handling by the kidney. Both AGE-RAGE
axis and adipokine dysregulation activate intracellular signaling pathways,
increase oxidative stress, and aggravate vascular inflammation. Pancreatic β-cell
specific microRNAs are implicated in gene expression and diabetic complications. 
Non-pharmacological intervention with lifestyle changes improves BP control, and 
anti-hypertensive medications with ACEI/ARB, calcium antagonists, β-blockers,
diuretics and new hypoglycemic agent SGLT2 inhibitors are effective to decrease
mortality and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. For hypertensive
patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease, control of
BP < 130/80 mmHg but not < 120/70 mmHg is reasonable, whereas for those with
chronic total occlusion or acute coronary syndromes, an ideal BP target may be
somewhat higher (< 140/90 mmHg). Caution is advised with aggressive lowering of
diastolic BP to a critical threshold (< 60 mmHg).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and T2DM share certain similar aspects of
pathophysiology, and BP control should be individualized to minimize adverse
events and maximize benefits especially for patients with T2DM and coronary
artery disease.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31733658.pdf

tests is one of the main challenges. In this study, we propose a new
single-marker association test called C-JAMP (Copula-based Joint Analysis of
Multiple Phenotypes), which is based on a joint model of multiple phenotypes
given genetic markers and other covariates. We evaluated its performance and
compared its empirical type I error and power with existing univariate and
multivariate single-marker and multi-marker rare-variant tests in extensive
simulation studies. C-JAMP yielded unbiased genetic effect estimates and valid
type I errors with an adjusted test statistic. When strongly dependent traits
were jointly analyzed, C-JAMP had the highest power in all scenarios except when 
a high percentage of variants were causal with moderate/small effect sizes. When 
traits with weak or moderate dependence were analyzed, whether C-JAMP or
competing approaches had higher power depended on the effect size. When C-JAMP
was applied with a misspecified copula function, it still achieved high power in 
some of the scenarios considered. In a real-data application, we analyzed
sequencing data using C-JAMP and performed the first genome-wide association
studies of high-molecular-weight and medium-molecular-weight adiponectin plasma
concentrations. C-JAMP identified 20 rare variants with p-values smaller than
10-5 , while all other tests resulted in the identification of fewer variants
with higher p-values. In summary, the results indicate that C-JAMP is a powerful,
flexible, and robust method for association studies, and we identified novel
candidate markers for adiponectin. C-JAMP is implemented as an R package and

half of these cases are due to cirrhosis, which is an advanced stage of liver
fibrosis that can be accompanied by liver failure and portal hypertension. Early 
detection of liver fibrosis helps in improving its treatment and prevents its
progression to cirrhosis. In this work, we present a novel noninvasive method to 
detect liver fibrosis from tagged MRI images using a machine learning-based
approach. Specifically, coronal and sagittal tagged MRI imaging are analyzed
separately to capture cardiac-induced deformation of the liver. The liver is
manually delineated and a novel image feature, namely, the histogram of the peak 
strain (HPS) value, is computed from the segmented liver region and is used to
classify the liver as being either normal or fibrotic. Classification is achieved
using a support vector machine algorithm. The in vivo study included 15 healthy
volunteers (10 males; age range 30-45 years) and 22 patients (15 males; age range
25-50 years) with liver fibrosis verified and graded by transient elastography,
and 10 patients only had a liver biopsy and were diagnosed with a score of F3-F4.
The proposed method demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of extracting the 
HPS features from the sagittal slices for patients with moderate fibrosis.
Cross-validation of the method showed an accuracy of 83.7% (specificity = 86.6%, 
sensitivity = 81.8%).

considerable training is required to identify the target vessels and understand

such as the edge-detection method, manual correction is necessary for accurate
segmentation of coronary vessels. In the present study, we proposed a robust

Robust predictability was validated for the external dataset with different image

Anvillea radiate (A. radiata) aerial parts (AEAR) on arterial blood pressure in
normotensive and hypertensive rats.
METHODS: The effect of the acute and sub-chronic administration of AEAR on the
following blood pressure parameters: systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood
pressure (MBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) was evaluated
in normotensive and L-NAME induced hypertensive rats. In the second experiment
the vasorelaxant effect of AEAR was assessed in isolated rat aortic rings with
functional endothelium pre-contracted with epinephrine (EP) or KCl, and six
antagonists/inhibitors were used to explore the mechanisms of action involved in 
the vasorelaxant effect. In order to determine the phytochemical contents of
Anvillea radiata HPLC-ESI-MS analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Daily oral administration of AEAR (100 mg/kg) provoked a significant
decrease in SBP, MBP, and DBP without affecting HR in hypertensive rats. In
addition, AEAR (0.08-0.64 mg/ml) revealed a vasorelaxant effect in thoracic
aortic rings pre-contracted by EP (10 µM) or KCl (80 mM). This effect was reduced
in the presence of Nifedipine, L-Name or Methylene blue. The polyphenolic
compounds of AEAR were determined.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that AEAR possesses a potent antihypertensive
activity and its vasorelaxant activity seems to be mediated through Ca2+
channels, direct nitric oxide (NO), and NO/cGMP pathways. Chlorogenic acid and
caffeic acid identified in A. radiata could be at least partially responsible for
the antihypertensive activity of this extract.

carotid and coronary atherosclerosis and inflammatory biomarker levels among HIV 
controllers, LTNPs and noncontrollers and HIV-uninfected individuals in the
Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women's Interagency HIV Study
(WIHS).
METHODS: We measured carotid plaque presence and common carotid artery
intima-media thickness (IMT) in 1729 women and 1308 men, and the presence of
coronary artery calcium and plaque in a subgroup of men. Associations between HIV
control category and carotid and coronary plaque prevalences were assessed by
multivariable regression analyses adjusting for demographics and CVD risk
factors. Serum inflammatory biomarker concentrations [soluble CD163 (sCD163),
soluble CD14 (sCD14), galectin-3 (Gal-3), galectin-3 binding protein (Gal-3BP)
and interleukin (IL)-6] were measured and associations with HIV control category 
assessed.
RESULTS: We included 135 HIV controllers (30 ECs) and 135 LTNPs in the study.
Carotid plaque prevalence and carotid IMT were similar in HIV controllers, LTNPs 
and HIV-uninfected individuals. HIV controllers and LTNPs had lower prevalences
of carotid plaque compared to viraemic HIV-infected individuals. The prevalence
of coronary atherosclerosis was similar in HIV controllers/LTNPs compared to
HIV-uninfected and viraemic HIV-infected men. Controllers and LTNPs had higher
concentrations of sCD163 and sCD14 compared to HIV-uninfected persons.
CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical CVD was similar in HIV controllers, LTNPs and
HIV-uninfected individuals despite elevated levels of some inflammatory

contractility. Two genetic variants have recently been discovered to regulate
PRKCA expression in failing human heart tissue (rs9909004 [T → C] and rs9303504
[C → G]). The association of those variants with clinical outcomes in patients
with heart failure (HF), and their interaction with HF drug efficacy, is unknown.
METHODS: Patients with HF in a prospective registry starting in 2007 were
genotyped by whole genome array (n = 951). The primary outcome was all-cause
mortality. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for established clinical risk
factors and genomic ancestry tested the independent association of rs9909004 or
rs9303504 and the variant interactions with cornerstone HF pharmacotherapies
(beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor
blockers) in additive genetic models.
RESULTS: The minor allele of rs9909004, but not of rs9303504, was independently
associated with a decreased risk for all-cause mortality: adjusted HR = 0.81 (95%
CI = 0.67-0.98), p = 0.032. The variants did not significantly interact with
mortality benefit associated with cornerstone HF pharmacotherapies (p > 0.1 for
all).
CONCLUSIONS: A recently discovered cardiac-specific regulatory variant for PRKCA 
(rs9909004) was independently associated with a decreased risk for all-cause

artery calcium (CAC) scoring software, using a semi-automatic software as a
reference.
METHODS: This observational study included 315 consecutive, non-contrast-enhanced
calcium scoring computed tomography (CSCT) scans. A semi-automatic and an
automatic software obtained the Agatston score (AS), the volume score (VS), the
mass score (MS), and the number of calcified coronary lesions. Semi-automatic and
automatic analysis time were registered, including a manual double-check of the
automatic results. Statistical analyses were Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient (⍴), intra-class correlation (ICC), Bland Altman plots, weighted
kappa analysis (κ), and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: The correlation and agreement for the AS, VS, and MS were ⍴ = 0.935,
0.932, 0.934 (p < 0.001), and ICC = 0.996, 0.996, 0.991, respectively (p <

feature analysis of late gadolinium enhancement images on cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia
(VT) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 64 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac MRI and 24-hour Holter
monitoring within 1 year before cardiac MRI. There were 42 men and 22 women with 
a mean age of 48.13±13.06 (SD) years (range: 20-70 years). Quantitative textural 
features were extracted via manually placed regions of interest in areas with
high and intermediate signal intensity on late gadolinium-chelate enhanced
images. Feature selection and dimension reduction were performed. The diagnostic 
performances of machine learning classifiers including support vector machines,
Naive Bayes, k-nearest-neighbors, and random forest for predicting the presence
of VT were assessed using the results of 24-hour Holter monitoring as the
reference test. All machine learning models were assessed with and without the
application of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE).
RESULTS: Of the 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 21/64 (32.8%) had
VT. Of eight machine learning models investigated, k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE
exhibited the best diagnostic accuracy for the presence or absence of VT.
k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE correctly identified 40/42 (95.2%) VT-positive
patients and 40/43 (93.0%) VT-negative patients, yielding 95.2% sensitivity (95% 
CI: 82.5%-99.1%), 93.0% specificity (95% CI: 79.8%-98.1%) and 94.1% accuracy (95%
CI: 88.8%-98%).
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based texture analysis of late gadolinium-chelate
enhancement-positive areas is a promising tool for the classification of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with and without VT.

brain/neural-computer interfaces (BNCI) have the potential to restore the
capabilities of handicapped people to carry out activities of daily living. To
improve applicability of such systems, workload and stress should be reduced to a
minimal level. Here, we investigated the user's physiological reactions during
the exhaustive use of the interfaces of a hybrid control interface. Eleven
BNCI-naive healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. All participants
sat in a comfortable chair in front of a desk and wore a whole-arm exoskeleton as
well as wearable devices for monitoring physiological, electroencephalographic
(EEG) and electrooculographic (EoG) signals. The experimental protocol consisted 
of three phases: (i) Set-up, calibration and BNCI training; (ii) Familiarization 
phase; and (iii) Experimental phase during which each subject had to perform EEG 
and EoG tasks. After completing each task, the NASA-TLX questionnaire and
self-assessment manikin (SAM) were completed by the user. We found significant
differences (p-value < 0.05) in heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance
level (SCL) between participants during the use of the two different biosignal
modalities (EEG, EoG) of the BNCI. This indicates that EEG control is associated 
with a higher level of stress (associated with a decrease in HRV) and mental work
load (associated with a higher level of SCL) when compared to EoG control. In

most patients are undiagnosed and untreated because it is difficult for patients 
themselves to notice OSA in daily living. Polysomnography (PSG), which is the
gold standard test for sleep disorder diagnosis, cannot be performed in many
hospitals. This fact motivates us to develop a simple system for screening OSA at
home.
APPROACH: The autonomic nervous system changes during apnea, and such changes
affect heart rate variability (HRV). This work develops a new apnea screening
method based on HRV analysis and machine learning technologies. An apnea/normal
respiration (A/N) discriminant model is built for respiration condition
estimation for every heart rate measurement, and an apnea/sleep ratio is
introduced for final diagnosis. A random forest is adopted for the A/N
discriminant model construction, which is trained with the PhysioNet apnea-ECG
database.
MAIN RESULTS: The screening performance of the proposed method was evaluated by
applying it to clinical PSG data. Sensitivity and specificity achieved 76% and
92%, respectively, which are comparable to existing portable sleep monitoring
devices used in sleep laboratories.
SIGNIFICANCE: Since the proposed OSA screening method can be used more easily
than existing devices, it will contribute to OSA treatment.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31726434.pdf

risks during catastrophic storms, few evaluated the population vulnerability
which is more important for identifying areas in greatest need of intervention.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between community factors and multiple
health outcomes, and developed a community vulnerability index.
METHODS: We retained emergency department visits for several health conditions
from the 2005-2014 New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System.
We developed distributed lag nonlinear models at each spatial cluster across
eight counties in downstate New York to evaluate the health risk associated with 
Superstorm Sandy (10/28/2012-11/9/2012) compared to the same period in other
years, then defined census tracts in clusters with an elevated risk as
""risk-elevated communities"", and all others as ""unelevated"". We used
machine-learning techniques to regress the risk elevation status against
community factors to determine the contribution of each factor on population
vulnerability, and developed a community vulnerability index (CVI).
RESULTS: Overall, community factors had positive contributions to increased
community vulnerabilities to Sandy-related substance abuse (91.35%), injuries
(70.51%), cardiovascular diseases (8.01%), and mental disorders (2.71%) but
reversely contributed to respiratory diseases (-34.73%). The contribution of low 
per capita income (max: 22.08%), the percentage of residents living in group
quarters (max: 31.39%), the percentage of areas prone to flooding (max: 38.45%), 
and the percentage of green coverage (max: 29.73%) tended to be larger than other
factors. The CVI based on these factors achieved an accuracy of 0.73-0.90 across 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that substance abuse was the most sensitive
disease susceptible to less optimal community indicators, whereas respiratory
diseases were higher in communities with better social environment. The
percentage of residents in group quarters and areas prone to flooding were among 
dominant predictors for community vulnerabilities. The CVI based on these factors
has an appropriate predictive performance.

(DyLight 350 plus Pacific Orange) with five-color surface marker antibody and
intracellular staining for phosphoprotein signaling analysis. We proposed a
robust method to measure intra- and inter-assay variability of FCB in T/B cells
and monocytes by combining range and ratio of variability to standard statistical
analyses. Data analysis was carried out by conventional and semi-automated
workflows and built with R software. Results obtained from both analyses were
compared to assess feasibility and reproducibility of FCB data analysis by
machine-learning methods. Our results showed efficient FCB using DyLight 350 and 
Pacific Orange at concentrations of 0, 15 or 30, and 250 μg/mL, and a high
reproducibility of FCB in combination with surface marker and intracellular
antibodies. Inter-operator variability was minimized by adding an internal
control bridged across matrices used as rejection criterion if significant
differences were present between runs. Computational workflows showed comparable 
results to conventional gating strategies. FCB can be used to study
phosphoprotein signaling in T/B cells and monocytes with high reproducibility
across operators, and the addition of bridge internal controls can further
minimize inter-operator variability. This FCB protocol, which has high throughput
analysis and low intra- and inter-assay variability, can be a powerful tool for
clinical trial studies. Moreover, FCB data can be reliably analyzed using
computational software.

predict patient deterioration, bedside assessment by nurses should not be
overlooked. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of subjective bedside
assessment of the patient by the rapid response team (RRT) nurses in predicting
short-term patient deterioration.
METHODS: Patients noticed by RRT nurses based on the vital sign instability,
abnormal laboratory results, and direct contact via phone between November 1,
2016, and December 12, 2017, were included. Five RRT nurses visited the patients 
according to their shifts and assessed the possibility of patient deterioration. 
Patient acuity rating (PAR), a scale of 1-7, was used as the tool of bedside
assessment. Other scores, including the modified early warning score, VitalPAC
early warning score, standardised early warning score, and cardiac arrest risk
triage, were calculated afterwards. The performance of these scores in predicting
mortality and/or intensive care unit admission within 1 day was compared by
calculating the area under the receiver operating curve.
RESULTS: A total of 1,426 patients were included in the study, of which 258
(18.1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit within 1 day. The area
under the receiver operating curve of PAR was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]

In patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, the functional significance
of a coronary artery stenosis needs to be determined to guide treatment. This is 
typically established through fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement,
performed during invasive coronary angiography (ICA). We present a method for
automatic and non-invasive detection of patients requiring ICA, employing deep
unsupervised analysis of complete coronary arteries in cardiac CT angiography
(CCTA) images. We retrospectively collected CCTA scans of 187 patients, 137 of
them underwent invasive FFR measurement in 192 different coronary arteries. These
FFR measurements served as a reference standard for the functional significance
of the coronary stenosis. The centerlines of the coronary arteries were extracted
and used to reconstruct straightened multi-planar reformatted (MPR) volumes. To
automatically identify arteries with functionally significant stenosis that
require ICA, each MPR volume was encoded into a fixed number of encodings using
two disjoint 3D and 1D convolutional autoencoders performing spatial and
sequential encodings, respectively. Thereafter, these encodings were employed to 
classify arteries using a support vector machine classifier. The detection of
coronary arteries requiring invasive evaluation, evaluated using repeated
cross-validation experiments, resulted in an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 0.81±0.02 on the artery-level, and 0.87±0.02 on the
patient-level. The results demonstrate the feasibility of automatic non-invasive 
detection of patients that require ICA and possibly subsequent coronary artery
intervention. This could potentially reduce the number of patients that
unnecessarily undergo ICA.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31725371.pdf

first postpartum months. Many patients recover well within the first year, but
long-term outcome studies on morbidity and mortality are rare. Here, we present
5-year follow-up data of a German PPCM cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Five-year follow-up data were available for 66 PPCM patients
(mean age 34 ± 5 years) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 
26 ± 9% at diagnosis. Ninety-eight percent initially received standard heart
failure therapy (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists), and 86% were additionally treated with dopamine D2 receptor
agonists (mainly bromocriptine) and anticoagulation. After 1 year, mean LVEF had 
improved to 50 ± 11% (n = 48) and further increased to 54 ± 7% at 5-year
follow-up with 72% of patients having achieved full cardiac recovery (LVEF >50%).
At 5-year follow-up, only three patients (5%) displayed no recovery, of whom one 
had died. However, 20% had arterial hypertension and 17% arrhythmias, including
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular 
fibrillation. Moreover, 70% were still on at least one heart failure drug.
Subsequent pregnancy occurred in 16 patients with two abortions and 14 uneventful
pregnancies. Mean LVEF was 55 ± 7% at 5-year follow-up in these patients.
CONCLUSION: Our PPCM collective treated with standard therapy for heart failure, 
dopamine D2 receptor agonists, and anticoagulation displays a high and stable
long-term recovery rate with low mortality at 5-year follow-up. However,
long-term use of cardiovascular medication, persisting or de novo hypertension

and CVD has not been well established.
AIM: We aimed to compare the CVD risk between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients,
and explored the factors associated with subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHOD: Consecutive NAFLD patients estimated by magnetic resonance imaging-based 
proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) were recruited. Liver fat content (LFC)
and liver stiffness were measured with MRI-PDFF and shear wave elastography,
respectively. CVD risk was estimated by atherosclerosis index (AI), carotid

RESULTS: This study included 543 NAFLD patients. The presence of carotid

events (MALEs), and risk factors for OS and MALEs were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding factors, the attributable risk for OS
was similar among isolated AI, FP, and BTK treatments. MALEs increased in
correlation with the number of treatment locations. Dialysis, critical limb
ischemia, and cardiac contractile dysfunction were the common risk factors for OS
and MALEs. However, the contribution of other factors such as type of drug usage 
was different according to treatment locations.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PAD, OS was largely defined by comorbidities but
not by lesion location. The background risk factors, underlying comorbidities,
and event rates were different according to PAD location, suggesting that
stratified treatment should be established for different patient populations.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31723087.pdf

are now poised to meet the fields of precision medicine and personalized therapy.
Network medicine integrates standard clinical recording and non-invasive,
advanced cardiac imaging tools with epigenetics into deep learning for in-depth
CHD molecular phenotyping. This approach could potentially explore developing
novel drugs from natural compounds (i.e. polyphenols, folic acid) and repurposing
current drugs, such as statins and metformin. Several clinical trials have
exploited epigenetic tags and epigenetic sensitive drugs both in primary and
secondary prevention. Due to their stability in plasma and easiness of detection,
many ongoing clinical trials are focused on the evaluation of circulating miRNAs 
(e.g. miR-8059 and miR-320a) in blood, in association with imaging parameters
such as coronary calcifications and stenosis degree detected by coronary computed
tomography angiography (CCTA), or functional parameters provided by FFR/CT and

(HF). However, current strategies for predicting risk are only modestly
successful, likely because they are derived from statistical analysis methods
that fail to capture prognostic information in large data sets containing
multi-dimensional interactions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a machine learning algorithm to capture correlations
between patient characteristics and mortality. A model was built by training a
boosted decision tree algorithm to relate a subset of the patient data with a
very high or very low mortality risk in a cohort of 5822 hospitalized and
ambulatory patients with HF. From this model we derived a risk score that
accurately discriminated between low and high-risk of death by identifying eight 
variables (diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,
haemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, albumin, and red blood cell
distribution width). This risk score had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88
and was predictive across the full spectrum of risk. External validation in two
separate HF populations gave AUCs of 0.84 and 0.81, which were superior to those 
obtained with two available risk scores in these same populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning and readily available variables, we generated
and validated a mortality risk score in patients with HF that was more accurate
than other risk scores to which it was compared. These results support the use of
this machine learning approach for the evaluation of patients with HF and in
other settings where predicting risk has been challenging.

lower than expected for the average glucose levels in different individuals)
could lead to errors if diagnostic classification is based only on HbA1c levels.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 3106 participants without known diabetes
underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (fasting glucose and 2-h glucose)
and a 50-g glucose challenge test (1-h glucose) on separate days. They were
classified by oral glucose tolerance test results as having: normal glucose
metabolism; prediabetes; or diabetes. Predicted HbA1c was determined from the
linear regression modelling the relationship between observed HbA1c and average
glucose (mean of fasting glucose and 2-h glucose from the oral glucose tolerance 
test, and 1-h glucose from the glucose challenge test) within oral glucose
tolerance test groups. The haemoglobin glycation index was calculated as
[observed - predicted HbA1c ], and divided into low, intermediate and high
haemoglobin glycation index mismatch tertiles.
RESULTS: Those participants with higher mismatches were more likely to be black, 
to be men, to be older, and to have higher BMI (all P<0.001). Using oral glucose 
tolerance test criteria, the distribution of normal glucose metabolism,
prediabetes and diabetes was similar across mismatch tertiles; however, using
HbA1c criteria, the participants with low mismatches were classified as 97%
normal glucose metabolism, 3% prediabetes and 0% diabetes, i.e. mostly normal,
while those with high mismatches were classified as 13% normal glucose
metabolism, 77% prediabetes and 10% diabetes, i.e. mostly abnormal (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Measuring only HbA1c could lead to under-diagnosis in people with
low mismatches and over-diagnosis in those with high mismatches. Additional oral 
glucose tolerance tests and/or fasting glucose testing to complement HbA1c in
diagnostic classification should be performed in most individuals.

aging decreases cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and the rate of decline is

pathological conditions such as hypertension and type II diabetes, and the
reduction is greater in female patients than male patients. There is no clear sex

microRNAs to aid in disease diagnosis. In this study, we sought the possible
utility of serum exosome microRNAs as biomarkers for disease activity in multiple
sclerosis patients in response to fingolimod therapy. We studied patients with
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis prior to and 6 months after treatment with
fingolimod. Disease activity was determined using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging. Serum exosome microRNAs were profiled using next-generation
sequencing. Data were analysed using univariate/multivariate modelling and
machine learning to determine microRNA signatures with predictive utility.
Accordingly, we identified 15 individual miRNAs that were differentially
expressed in serum exosomes from post-treatment patients with active versus
quiescent disease. The targets of these microRNAs clustered in ontologies related
to the immune and nervous systems and signal transduction. While the power of
individual microRNAs to predict disease status post-fingolimod was modest
(average 77%, range 65 to 91%), several combinations of 2 or 3 miRNAs were able
to distinguish active from quiescent disease with greater than 90% accuracy.
Further stratification of patients identified additional microRNAs associated
with stable remission, and a positive response to fingolimod in patients with
active disease prior to treatment. Overall, these data underscore the value of
serum exosome microRNA signatures as non-invasive biomarkers of disease in
multiple sclerosis and suggest they may be used to predict response to fingolimod
in future clinical practice. Additionally, these data suggest that fingolimod may

METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 602 coronary lesions from 602 angina patients were
randomized into training and test sets at a 4:1 ratio. A DenseNet model was
developed to classify OCT frames with or without OCT-derived TCFA.
Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to visualize the area of
attention. In the training sample (35,678 frames of 480 lesions), the model with 
5-fold cross-validation had an overall accuracy of 91.6±1.7%, sensitivity of
88.7±3.4%, and specificity of 91.8±2.0% (averaged AUC=0.96±0.01) in predicting
the presence of TCFA. In the test samples (9,722 frames of 122 lesions), the
overall accuracy at the frame level was 92.8% within the lesion (AUC=0.96) and
91.3% in the entire OCT pullback. The correlation between the %TCFA burdens per

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography data of 530 patients who underwent
CACS scan were included retrospectively. The scoring (including Agatston, mass,
and volume scores) was done manually. The deep-learning method was trained using 
data from 300 patients to calculate CACS based on the manual calculation. The
automated method was validated on a set of data from 90 patients and subsequently
tested on a new set of data from 140 patients against manual CACS. For the data
from 140 patients that were used to analyse the accuracy of deep-learning
algorithm, the total CACS obtained manually and by using the deep-learning
algorithm was recorded. Agatston score categories and cardiac risk categorisation
of the two methods were compared.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the manually derived and
deep-learning Agatston, mass, and volume scores. The Agatston score categories
and cardiac risk stratification displayed excellent agreement between the two
methods, with kappa = 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.73-0.81); however, a
13% reclassification rate was observed.
CONCLUSION: Deep-learning algorithm can provide reliable Agatston, mass, and

overall index (OI) and anterior index (AI) regarding normal occlusion and Angle's
malocclusion according to gender, and to assess if these indices support Bolton's
standards as general references.
METHODS: PubMed, LILACS, Embase, CENTRAL and Google Scholar databases were
searched up to June 2019 (CRD42018088438). Non-randomised clinical studies,
published in English and assessing Bolton's OI and/or AI in normal occlusion and 
Angle's malocclusion groups, were included. OI and AI means, sample size and SDs 
were collected. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Quality
Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to 
assess the risk of bias. Pairwise random-effects and multilevel Bayesian network 
meta-analyses were used to synthesise available data.
RESULTS: Fifty-three observational studies were included (11,411 participants;
3746 men, 4430 women; 15 studies lacked gender information). For normal
occlusion, pooled estimates for OI and AI means were 91.78% (95% confidence
interval [CI] = 91.42-92.14; I2 = 92.87%) and 78.25% (95% CI = 77.87-78.62; I2 = 
90.67%), respectively. We could identify in Angle's Class III patients meaningful
OI and AI mean deviations from normal occlusion (0.76, 95% credible interval
[CrI] = 0.55-0.98 and 0.61, 95% CrI = 0.35-0.87, respectively), while in Class II
patients we found a meaningful mean deviation from normal occlusion only for OI
(-0.28, 95% CrI = -0.52--0.05). Concerning gender impact, male patients presented
higher OI (0.30, 95% CI = 0.00-0.59) and AI (0.41, 95% CI = 0.00-0.83) mean
values than female patients in Class I.
CONCLUSION: Normal occlusion OI and AI mean values differ from Bolton's original 
values. Class II division 2, for OI mean values, and Class III, for both OI and
AI, are proportionally larger than normal occlusion patients. Gender had almost
no impact on teeth mesiodistal proportion.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31718451.pdf

estimate the deformed geometry of the TAV leaflets and the associated stress
distributions within a second, with the direct ML-models (ML-model-d) having
slightly larger errors. In conclusion, although this is a proof-of-concept study,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six machine-learning algorithms were applied to predict
30-day QALY for 777 patients admitted in a prospective cohort study conducted in 
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of two public Brazilian hospitals specialized in
cancer care. The predictors were 37 characteristics collected at ICU admission.
Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) curve. Sensitivity, 1-specificity, true/false positive and
negative cases were measured for different estimated probability cutoff points
(30%, 20% and 10%). Calibration was evaluated with GiViTI calibration belt and
test.
RESULTS: Except for basic decision trees, the adjusted predictive models were
nearly equivalent, presenting good results for discrimination (AUROC curves over 
0.80). Artificial neural networks and gradient boosted trees achieved the overall
best calibration, implying an accurately predicted probability for 30-day QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Except for basic decision trees, predictive models derived from
different machine-learning algorithms discriminated the QALY risk at 30 days
well. Regarding calibration, artificial neural network model presented the best
ability to estimate 30-day QALY in critically ill oncologic patients admitted to 
ICUs.

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate a novel artificial intelligence (AI)
screening tool for detecting low EF in primary care practices.
DESIGN: The EAGLE trial is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomized trial
(NCT04000087) that will randomize >100 clinical teams (i.e., clusters) to either 
intervention (access to the new AI screening tool) or control (usual care) at 48 
primary care practices across Minnesota and Wisconsin. The trial is expected to
involve approximately 400 clinicians and 20,000 patients. The primary endpoint is
newly discovered EF ≤50%. Eligible patients will include adults who undergo ECG
for any reason and have not been previously diagnosed with low EF. Data will be
pulled from the EHR, and no contact will be made with patients. A positive
deviance qualitative study and a post-implementation survey will be conducted
among select clinicians to identify facilitators and barriers to using the new
screening report.
SUMMARY: This trial will examine the effectiveness of the AI-enabled ECG for
detection of asymptomatic low EF in routine primary care practices and will be
among the first to prospectively evaluate the value of AI in real-world practice.
Its findings will inform future implementation strategies for the translation of 
other AI-enabled algorithms.

STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: In all, 175 (350 MRI scans; 1050 image series) clinical patients
under both rest and stress conditions (135/10/30 training/validation/test).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T/2D multislice saturation recovery T1 -weighted
gradient echo sequence.
ASSESSMENT: Accuracy was assessed, as compared to the manual operator, through
the mean square error of the distance between landmarks and the Dice similarity
coefficient of the segmentation and bounding box detection. Quantitative
perfusion maps obtained using the automated DL-based processing were compared to 
the results obtained with the manually processed images.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) were used to assess the myocardial blood flow (MBF) obtained using the
automated DL pipeline, as compared to values obtained by a manual operator.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) error in the detection of the time of peak signal
enhancement in the left ventricle was 1.49 (1.4) timeframes. The mean (SD) Dice
similarity coefficients for the bounding box and myocardial segmentation were
0.93 (0.03) and 0.80 (0.06), respectively. The mean (SD) error in the RV
insertion point was 2.8 (1.8) mm. The Bland-Altman plots showed a bias of 2.6% of
the mean MBF between the automated and manually processed MBF values on a
per-myocardial segment basis. The ICC was 0.89, 95% confidence interval = [0.87, 
0.90].
DATA CONCLUSION: We showed high accuracy, compared to manual processing, for the 
DL-based processing of myocardial perfusion data leading to quantitative values
that are similar to those achieved with manual processing.

HFD altered lipid metabolism and HDL oxidation and also induced liver steatosis

METHODS: Out of 3,301 MRIs from 12 sites in the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Stroke Genetics Network (SiGN), we
included 2,381 cases with acute DWI lesions. The definition of ACiS or PCiS was
based on lesion location. We compared the groups using Chi-squared and logistic
regression.
RESULTS: PCiS occurred in 718 (30%) patients and ACiS in 1663 (70%). Diabetes and
male sex were more common in PCiS vs. ACiS (diabetes 27% vs. 23%, p < 0.05; male 
sex 68% vs. 58%, p < 0.001). Both were independently associated with PCiS
(diabetes, OR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.04-1.61; male sex, OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.21-1.78).
ACiS more commonly had large artery atherosclerosis (25% vs. 20%, p < 0.01) and
cardioembolic mechanisms (17% vs. 11%, p < 0.001) compared to PCiS. Small artery 
occlusion was more common in PCiS vs. ACiS (20% vs. 14%, p < 0.001). Small artery
occlusion accounted for 47% of solitary brainstem infarctions.
CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke subtypes differ between the two phenotypes. Diabetes 
and male sex have a stronger association with PCiS than ACiS. Definitive
MRI-based PCiS diagnosis aids etiological investigation and contributes
additional insights into specific risk factors and mechanisms of injury in PCiS.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31709475.pdf

defined and the pathophysiological consequences considered. Pharmacological
treatment depends on the disease- and age-specific myocardial characteristics.
Acute and chronic low cardiac output is the result of an inadequate heart rate
(rhythm), myocardial contractility, preload and afterload, and also
ventriculo-ventricular interaction, synchrony, atrio-ventricular and
ventricular-arterial coupling. The treatment of choice is curing the cause of
heart failure, if possible. Acute HF therapy is still based to the use of
catecholamines and inodilators. The cornerstone of chronic HF treatment consists 
of blocking the endogenous, neuro-humoral axis, in particular the adrenergic and 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.Before neprilysin inhibitors are used in
young children, their potential side-effect for inducing Alzheimer disease needs 
to be clarified. The focus of the current review is put on the differential use
of the inotropic drugs as epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and dobutamine,
and also the inodilators milrinone and levosimendan. Considering effects and
side-effects of any cardiac stimulating treatment strategy, co-medication with
ß-blockers, angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin blockers
(ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is not a contradiction, 
but a senseful measure, even still during the acute inotropic treatment.Missing
sophisticated clinical trials using accurate entry criteria and clinically
relevant endpoints, there is especially in cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment

algorithm in estimating operative mortality risk in cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Index adult cardiac operations performed between 2011-2017 at a single
institution were included. The primary outcome was operative mortality. Extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were developed and evaluated using 10-fold
cross validation with 1000-replication bootstrapping. Model performance was
assessed using multiple measures including precision, recall, calibration plots, 
area under receiver operating characteristic curve (c-index), accuracy, and F1
score.
RESULTS: A total of 11,190 patients were included (7,048 isolated coronary artery
bypass grafting [CABG], 2,507 isolated valves, and 1,635 CABG plus valves). The
Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) was 3.2% ±
5.0%. Actual operative mortality was 2.8%. There was moderate correlation
(r=0.652) in predicted risk between XGBoost versus STS-PROM for the overall
cohort and weak correlation (r=0.473) in predicted risk between the models
specifically in patients with operative mortality. XGBoost demonstrated
improvements in all measures of model performance when compared to STS-PROM in
the validation cohorts: mean average precision (0.221 XGBoost versus 0.180
STS-PROM), c-index (0.808 XGBoost versus 0.795 STS-PROM), calibration (mean
observed:expected mortality: XGBoost 0.993 versus 0.956 STS-PROM), accuracy (1-3%
improvement across discriminatory thresholds of 3-10% risk), and F1 score (0.281 
XGBoost versus 0.230 STS-PROM).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost have promise in
predictive analytics in cardiac surgery. The modest improvements in model
performance demonstrated in the current study warrant further validation in
larger cohorts of patients.

(AI) and machine learning (ML) as it relates to cardiovascular healthcare.
METHODS: An overview of the terminology and algorithms used in ML as it relates
to healthcare are provided by the author. Articles published up to August 1, 2019
in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed
in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical
practice in the future.
RESULTS: AI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform
intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of
machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body 
of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular healthcare. Moreover,
ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural 
language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and
predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest xrays,
electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography, identification of patients 
with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML, and predicting
mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular
procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in
cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice
remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing
automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, 
and clinical risk prediction although these techniques require further refinement
and evaluation.

cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Machine learning is increasingly used to
identify novel predictors of CVD risk, but prediction improvements beyond
established risk scores are uncertain. We evaluated improvements in predicting
5-year AF risk when adding novel candidate variables identified by machine
learning to the CHARGE-AF Enriched score, which includes age, race/ethnicity,
height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of
antihypertensive medication, diabetes, and NT-proBNP. We included 3,534
participants (mean age, 61.3 years; 52.0% female) with complete data from the
prospective Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Incident AF was defined based 
on study electrocardiograms and hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 codes,
supplemented by Medicare claims. Prediction performance was evaluated using Cox
regression and a parsimonious model was selected using LASSO. Within 5 years of
baseline, 124 participants had incident AF. Compared with the CHARGE-AF Enriched 
model (c-statistic, 0.804), variables identified by machine learning, including
biomarkers, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging variables, electrocardiogram
variables, and subclinical CVD variables, did not significantly improve
prediction. A 23-item score derived by machine learning achieved a c-statistic of
0.806, whereas a parsimonious model including the clinical risk factors age,
weight, current smoking, NT-proBNP, coronary artery calcium score, and cardiac
troponin-T achieved a c-statistic of 0.802. This analysis confirms that the
CHARGE-AF Enriched model and a parsimonious 6-item model performed similarly to a
more extensive model derived by machine learning. In conclusion, these simple
models remain the gold standard for risk prediction of AF, although addition of
the coronary artery calcium score should be considered.

demonstrated potential to decrease the assessment gap, between biochemical
determination and clinical manifestation, of a patient's response to treatment.
Although psoriasis is a proven testing ground for treatment-response prediction
using transcriptomic data from clinically accessible skin biopsies, these
biopsies are expensive, invasive, and challenging to obtain from certain body
areas. Response prediction from blood biochemical measurements could be a
cheaper, less invasive predictive platform. Longitudinal profiles for 92
inflammatory and 65 cardiovascular disease proteins were measured from the blood 
of psoriasis patients at baseline, and 4-weeks, following tofacitinib (janus
kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription-inhibitor) or etanercept 
(tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor) treatment, and predictive models were developed
by applying machine-learning techniques such as bagging and ensembles. This data 
driven approach developed predictive models able to accurately predict the
12-week clinical endpoint for psoriasis following tofacitinib (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve [auROC] = 78%), or etanercept (auROC =
71%) treatment in a validation dataset, revealing a robust predictive protein
signature including well-established psoriasis markers such as IL-17A and IL-17C,
highlighting potential for biologically meaningful and clinically useful response
predictions using blood protein data. Although most blood classifiers were
outperformed by simple models trained using Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores,
performance might be enhanced in future studies by measuring a wider variety of
proteins.

sinuses of Valsalva are superior to 45 mm particularly for bicuspid valve.
However, in case of tubular aorta aneurysms with moderate root dilatation
(40-45 mm diameter), the approach is still debated regarding the increased risk
of coronary reimplantation. We present a modified hemi-remodeling aortic repair
technique that includes the replacement of the noncoronary sinus, ascending
aorta, and valve repair with external ring annuloplasty in patients with bicuspid
aortic valve (BAV) and moderately dilated aortic root.
METHODS: Between 2003 and 2017, 18 patients presenting with left-right BAV and an
aortic root diameter at 42.3+/-3.3 mm underwent hemi-root and ascending aorta
replacement and aortic valve repair with external annuloplasty.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, 16 (88.9%) had no aortic insufficiency (AI) and 2
(11.1%) had grade I AI, no patients had grade III or grade IV AI. Overall
survival and freedom from grade II AI at 4 years and freedom from aortic
valve-related reoperation were 100%.
CONCLUSION: The standardized modified hemi-remodeling technique we present is a
safe and reproducible procedure, with satisfactory durability at follow-up. This 
technique represents an interesting alternative to full valve sparing root
replacement, as it avoids the operative risk of coronary reimplantation, allows
shorter cross-clamping time and a better exposition on the valve for a
symmetrical repair, placing the commissure at 180°, compared with valve sparing
root replacement.

for predicting post-Glenn shunt patients with low and high risks of a mean
pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 15 mmHg based on preoperative cardiac
computed tomography (CT).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 patients with functional single
ventricle who underwent a bidirectional Glenn procedure between November 1, 2009,
and July, 31, 2017. All patients underwent post-procedure CT, followed by cardiac
catheterization. Overall, 23 morphologic parameters were manually extracted from 
cardiac CT images for each patient. The Mann-Whitney U or chi-square test was
applied to select the most significant predictors. Six machine learning
algorithms including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, random forest (RF), linear
discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor were used
for modeling. These algorithms were independently trained on 100 train-validation
random splits with a 3:1 ratio. Their average performance was evaluated by area
under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Seven CT morphologic parameters were selected for modeling. RF obtained 
the best performance, with mean AUC of 0.840 (confidence interval [CI]
0.832-0.850) and 0.787 (95% CI 0.780-0.794); sensitivity of 0.815 (95% CI

0.771-0.793) and 0.756 (95% CI 0.748-0.764) in the training and validation
cohorts, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based RF model demonstrates a good performance in the
prediction of mPAP, which may reduce the need for right heart catheterization in 
post-Glenn shunt patients with suspected mPAP > 15 mmHg.

magnetic resonance (CMR) image is a very crucial procedure for clinical cardiac
disease diagnosis. Two traditional and commensal tasks, i.e., bi-ventricle
segmentation and direct ventricle function index estimation, are always
independently devoting to address ventricle quantification problem. However,
because of inherent difficulties from the variable CMR imaging conditions, these 
two tasks are still open challenging. In this paper, we proposed a unified
bi-ventricle quantification framework based on commensal correlation between the 
bi-ventricle segmentation and direct area estimation. Firstly, we proposed the
area commensal correlation between the two traditional cardiac quantification
tasks for the first time, and designed a novel deep commensal network (DCN) to
join these two commensal tasks into a unified framework based on the proposed
commensal correlation loss. Secondly, we proposed an differentiable area operator
to model the proposed area commensal correlation and made the proposed model
continuously differentiable. Thirdly, we proposed a high-efficiency and novel
uncertainty estimation method through one-time inference based on cross-task
output variability. And finally DCN achieved end-to-end optimization and fast
convergence as well as uncertainty estimation with one-time inference.
Experiments on the four open accessible short-axis CMR benchmark datasets (i.e., 
Sunnybrook, STACOM 2011, RVSC, and ACDC) showed that the proposed method achieves
best bi-ventricle quantification accuracy and optimization performance. Hence,
the proposed method has big potential to be extended to other medical image
analysis tasks and has clinical application value.

is often challenging. Automated ML (AutoML) has emerged as a powerful tool for
enabling the automatic selection of ML methods and parameter settings for the

optimization tool (TPOT) to predict angiographic diagnoses of coronary artery
disease (CAD). With TPOT, ML models are represented as expression trees and
optimal pipelines discovered using a stochastic search method called genetic
programming. We provide some guidelines for TPOT-based ML pipeline selection and 
optimization-based on various clinical phenotypes and high-throughput metabolic
profiles in the Angiography and Genes Study (ANGES).
RESULTS: We analyzed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-derived lipoprotein and
metabolite profiles in the ANGES cohort with a goal to identify the role of
non-obstructive CAD patients in CAD diagnostics. We performed a comparative
analysis of TPOT-generated ML pipelines with selected ML classifiers, optimized
with a grid search approach, applied to two phenotypic CAD profiles. As a result,
TPOT generated ML pipelines that outperformed grid search optimized models across
multiple performance metrics including balanced accuracy and area under the
precision-recall curve. With the selected models, we demonstrated that the
phenotypic profile that distinguishes non-obstructive CAD patients from no CAD
patients is associated with higher precision, suggesting a discrepancy in the
underlying processes between these phenotypes.

myocardial cell through reducing the myocardial ischemia and the apoptosis
pathway of both death receptors and mitochondria in acute exhausted rats.
METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6): control
group(Con), acute exhaustive swimming group (EE), low-dose and high-dose Sal
pre-treatment exhaustive swimming group (SLE, SHE). Rats were treated with Sal
solution (15 or 30 mg/(kg·d)) or 0.9%NaCl (3 ml/(kg·d)) by intraperitoneal
injection for 15 d, respectively. The Con group did not carry out swimming
training. The next day after the end of intraperitoneal administration, the rats 
in EE, SLE and SHE group were forced to swim until they were exhausted followed
the standard of Thomas. After the end of exhaustive exercise, the rats were
anesthetized and the blood samples and hearts were collected immediately. The
myocardial ischemia and hypoxia area and myocardial apoptosis index (AI) were
also observed. Serum ischemia modified albumin (IMA), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), 
brain natriuretic peptide(BNP) and myocardial cell Bcl-2-associated X protein

aspartate proteolytic enzyme-9(Caspase-9) were detected.
RESULTS: Compared with the Con group, the myocardial ischemia and hypoxia area in
EE group was increased significantly. The serum levels of IMA, cTnI and BNP, AI
and Bax levels and cardiac Fas, Cyto-C, Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9
protein expressions of EE group were also increased significantly (P＜0.01), while
the protein expression of Bcl-2 in cardiac tissues was decreased significantly

CONCLUSION: Sal plays a role in protecting myocardial cell through reducing the
myocardial ischemia and inhibiting myocardial cell apoptosis in exhaustive
exercise rats. The mechanism of reducing myocardial cell apoptosis may be related

therefore the discovery of potent BRD4 inhibitors with novel scaffolds is highly 
desirable. In this study, the crystalline water molecules in BRD4 involved in
ligand binding were analyzed first, and the simulation results suggest that
several conserved crystalline water molecules are quite essential to keep the
stability of the crystalline water network and therefore they need to be reserved

with the consideration of the conserved crystalline water network in the binding 
pocket was utilized to identify the potential inhibitors of BRD4. The in vitro
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF) binding assay illustrates that 4
hits have good inhibitory activity against BRD4 in the micromolar regime,
including three compounds with IC50 values below 5 μM and one below 1 μM (0.37
μM). The structural analysis demonstrates that three active compounds possess

associated with injection drug use has increased. Clinical guidelines suggest
deferring surgery for IE in people who inject drugs (PWID) due to a concern for
worse outcomes in comparison to non-injectors (non-PWID). We performed a
systematic review and meta-analysis of long-term outcomes in PWID who underwent
cardiac surgery and compared these outcomes to non-PWID.
METHODS: We systematically searched for studies reported between 1965 and 2018.
We used an algorithm to estimate individual patient data (eIPD) from Kaplan-Meier
(KM) curves and combined it with published individual patient data (IPD) to
analyze long-term outcomes after cardiac surgery for IE in PWID. Our primary
outcome was survival. Secondary outcomes were reoperation and mortality at
30-days, one-, five-, and 10-years. Random effects Cox regression was used for
estimating survival.
RESULTS: We included 27 studies in the systematic review and 19 provided data (KM
or IPD) for the meta-analysis. PWID were younger and more likely to have S.

number of them have been established as risk factors for chronic diseases.
However, it is not clear whether and to what extent adiposity, gene expression,
and other factors determine their circulating levels.
OBJECTIVES: To assess to what extent adiposity, as measured by the amount of
subcutaneous AT (SAT) and visceral AT (VAT) using magnetic resonance imaging, and
gene expression levels in SAT determine plasma concentrations of the adipokines
adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor, resistin, interleukin 6, and fatty 
acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4).
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 156 participants from the
EPIC Potsdam cohort study and analyzed multiple regression models and partial
correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: For leptin and FABP4 concentrations, 81 and 45% variance were explained 
by SAT mass, VAT mass, and gene expression in SAT in multivariable regression
models. For the remaining adipokines, AT mass and gene expression explained <16% 
variance of plasma concentrations. Gene expression in SAT was a less important
predictor compared to AT mass. SAT mass was a better predictor than VAT mass for 
leptin (partial correlation r = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.75-0.86, vs. r = 
0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.67), while differences between AT
compartments were small for the other adipokines.
CONCLUSIONS: While plasma levels of leptin and FABP4 can be explained in a large 
and medium part by the amount of AT and SAT gene expression, surprisingly, these 
predictors explained only little variance for all other investigated adipokines.

and CA impairment is an active field of research interest. A breath-hold
challenge is usually used in clinical and research settings to simulate
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular changes that mimic OSA events. This work
utilises temporal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and photoplethysmography
(PPG) signals to estimate the temporal cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv)
waveform. Measurements of CBFv, SpO2, and PPG, were acquired concurrently from
volunteers performing two different protocols of breath-hold challenge in the
supine position. Past values of the SpO2 and PPG signals were used to estimate
the current values of CBFv using different permutations and topologies of
supervised learning with shallow artificial neural networks (ANNs). The
measurements from one protocol were used to train the ANNs and find the optimum
topologies, which in turn were tested using the other protocol. Data collected
from 10 normotensive, healthy subjects (four females, age 28.5 ± 6.1 years, Body 
Mass Index (BMI) 24.0 ± 4.7 kg/m2) were used in this study. The results show that
different subjects have different optimum topologies for ANNs, thus indicating
the effects of inter-subject variability on ANNs. Successfully reconstructed
blind waveforms for the same subject group in the second protocol showed a
reasonable accuracy of 60-80% estimation compared to the measured
waveforms.HYPOTHESIS: Temporal waveforms for SpO2 and PPG contain adequate
information to estimate the temporal CBFv waveform using ANNs.
METHODOLOGY: Concurrent measurements of SpO2 and PPG using pulse oximetry from
the forehead and CBFv from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial
Doppler (TCD) were recorded from healthy, normotensive subjects performing a
breath-hold challenge. The breath-hold challenge mimicked the cerebrovascular
response to apnoea, and was recorded by measuring CBFv in MCA. Two protocols were
used, each consisting of five breath-holding manoeuvres and differing in terms of
the time between the five successive breath-holds. Using data from one protocol, 
several permutations of the temporal values of SpO2 and PPG signals were used as 
inputs to different ANN topologies, in order to train and find the optimum model.
The optimum model was evaluated using the data from the other protocol as a blind
dataset.
RESULTS: Using the first protocol for training, optimum ANN configurations were
found to be different for each subject, and accuracy of 75-87% was achieved. When
these optimum ANN models were tested using the second protocol as a blind
dataset, the accuracy achieved was around 60-80%.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach employing temporal records of SpO2 and PPG can be
used to estimate the CBFv waveform using ANNs with acceptable accuracy. Increases
in the size and diversity of the population dataset and the use of features
extracted from SpO2 and PPG signals are needed for generalisation of the method
and potential future clinical applications.

and 56,450 controls of European descent. The goal of our study has been to
integrate the complete GWAS results with a large-scale expression quantitative
trait loci (eQTL) mapping study in human lung tissues (n = 1,038) to identify
candidate causal genes for lung cancer. We performed transcriptome-wide
association study (TWAS) for lung cancer overall, by histology (adenocarcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer) and smoking subgroups (never-
and ever-smokers). We performed replication analysis using lung data from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. DNA damage assays were performed in
human lung fibroblasts for selected TWAS genes. As expected, the main TWAS signal
for all histological subtypes and ever-smokers was on chromosome 15q25. The gene 
most strongly associated with lung cancer at this locus using the TWAS approach
was IREB2 (pTWAS = 1.09E-99), where lower predicted expression increased lung
cancer risk. A new lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility locus was revealed on
9p13.3 and associated with higher predicted expression of AQP3 (pTWAS = 3.72E-6).
Among the 45 previously described lung cancer GWAS loci, we mapped candidate
target gene for 17 of them. The association AQP3-adenocarcinoma on 9p13.3 was
replicated using GTEx (pTWAS = 6.55E-5). Consistent with the effect of risk
alleles on gene expression levels, IREB2 knockdown and AQP3 overproduction
promote endogenous DNA damage. These findings indicate genes whose expression in 
lung tissue directly influences lung cancer risk.

death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients
is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the
capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using
survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data 
contributing to these diseases among the patients.
METHODS: Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised
machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an 
exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop
models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different
time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple
machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random
forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification
performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, 
capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve
detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify
the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of
at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models.
RESULTS: The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131
variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC)
score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory
results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient
Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data)
and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model
had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory
based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes
patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported weight, 4) leg length, and 
5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2)
systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported weight, 4) occurrence of chest pain,
and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors.
CONCLUSION: We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can 
provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes
and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction,
which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health
records.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31694707.pdf

periprocedural complications. The left ventricle (LV) remodelling process that
follows TAVR is considered to play an important role. We aim to investigate
whether gender difference affects the process of LV remodelling after TAVR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) after TAVR
were enrolled. Echocardiography was performed at baseline before the TAVR
procedure and repeated upon discharge, and at three, nine and 12 months
post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Women exhibited an early regression of LV mass and the LV mass index
(LVMi) decreased 12.0% from 148.3 ± 48.0 to 130.5 ± 43.7 g/m2 at just a median of
17 days after the procedure (P < .001). Almost one-half of the LVMi regression
occurred by 17 days post-TAVR and the LVMi regressed 22.0% by 12 months
post-TAVR. In contrast, the regression of LVMi in men seemed to be more gradual
and the significant regression of LVMi from baseline began to be observed since
three months later after TAVR. The LVMi reduction at nine months was 11.5% and
achieved 15.4% over one year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed
only the female sex, better LVEF and greater baseline LVMi were independently
associated with greater LVMi regression after TAVR, indicating female gender is
an independent predictor for favourable LV remodelling after TAVR.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, female patients with AS had favourable reverse
remodelling with greater and earlier LV mass regression post-TAVR compared with
the male patients.

focused traveling surface acoustic wave (FTSAW) to sort cells with high recovery

elasto-inertial particle focusing to align cells in a single file for improving
sorting accuracy and efficiency without sample dilution. Our sorting device can
effectively focus 1 μm particles which represents the general minimum size for a 
majority of cell sorting applications. Upon the fluorescence interrogation at the
single cell level, individual cells are deflected to the target outlet by a ∼50

different cell lines (i.e., MCF-7, MDA-231, and human-induced pluripotent
stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes; hiPSC-CMs) at ∼kHz with a sorting purity and
recovery rate both of about 90%. A further comparison demonstrates that the cell 
viability drops by 35-45% using a commercial FACS machine, while the cell
viability only drops by 3-4% using our aFACS system. The developed aFACS system

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an effective treatment for CA. Early and
high-quality CPR is closely related to the survival rate of patients with CA. But
manual chest compression has a lot of defects. To solve the defects and improve
the quality of CPR, mechanical CPR device was invented. However, it has still
controversy whether manual chest compression or mechanical chest compression is
better. This systematic review was aimed to investigate the difference in
clinical outcomes between manual chest compression and Lund University Cardiac
Assist System (LUCAS) assisted CPR in patients with out-hospital CA.
METHODS: Original research studies, conducted on adult out-of-hospital CA, were
included. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang
database were searched from the setting to February 21, 2019. Odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (CI) was selected as effect scale index for
evaluation of the difference in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),
survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, and survival to
30 days. Random effects model was used in this study to estimate overall mean
effects.
RESULTS: A total of 6 articles, including 4 randomized controlled trials and 2
nonrandomized controlled trials, were selected. And 8501 subjects were involved
to analyze the clinical outcomes of LUCAS and manual chest compression for
patients with out-hospital CA. Comparisons of ROSC (33.3% vs 33.0%, P = .98;
OR = 1; 95% CI: [0.89,1.13]), survival to hospital admission (22.7% vs 24.3%,
P = .32; OR = 0.86; 95% CI: [0.65,1.15]), survival to hospital discharge (8.6% vs

8.5%, P = .50; OR = 0.92; 95% CI: [0.73,1.17]) were made. No significant
difference was found.
CONCLUSION: The synthesis of available evidence does not support that mechanical

miRNAs in hearts isolated from wild-type, CRE, Tbx5lox/+and Tbx5del/+ mice using 
a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach. TBX5 deficiency in cardiomyocytes
increased the expression of the miR-183 cluster family that is controlled by

Accordingly, several calcium channel proteins identified as putative miR-182-5p

AAA (defined as 3 cm diameter) was calculated as a function of age and body mass

was grouped into one of three categories in 15-year intervals (35-50 years,
50-65 years, and 65 to 80 years). Most patients were Caucasian (n = 8575) and the
largest group of patients with a AAA was the Caucasian male (198 of 279 total
detected AAAs). A machine learning algorithm was written, with learning inputs
from the acquired patient database. Of all groups, Caucasian males were found to 
have the highest incidence of AAA, with males in general higher than females.
Smoking within the past two years was highly associated with AAA incidence, and a
past history of smoking to a lesser extent. The incidence of AAA increased with
age. When dividing groups into two cohorts by a BMI of 25, generally middle-aged 
patients with a BMI > 25 had a higher incidence of a AAA. However, in general,
the older age group with a BMI < 25 had a higher incidence of AAA. The addition
of machine learning allows one to note the effect of an input keeping other input
parameters constant. This helps identify a parameter that may be an independent
predictor of a particular outcome. When using BMI as the single changing input,
an increasing BMI was associated with an increased probability of a AAA, most
significantly in middle-aged patients, and then narrowing to similar
probabilities in older age. This AAA screening program is ongoing. As data
continues to be collected with particularly those patient groups presently
underrepresented, questions as to an association of AAA with BMI as a function of
age, and also an improvement in machine learning algorithm accuracy for various
patient populations will continue.

in the 1st month of life. Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes
of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring 
tool to identify high-risk women during labor.
Aim: The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning
algorithm techniques on CTG data in identifying high-risk fetuses.
Methods: CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were obtained from the University of
California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different machine learning
classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1
score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict 
normal, suspect, and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on
specified metrics was then identified.
Results: Determined by obstetricians' interpretation of CTGs as gold standard,
70% of them were normal, 20% were suspect, and 10% had a pathological fetal
state. On training data, the classification models generated by XGBoost, decision
tree, and random forest had high precision (>96%) to predict the suspect and
pathological state of the fetus based on the CTG tracings. However, on testing
data, XGBoost model had the highest precision to predict a pathological fetal
state (>92%).
Conclusion: The classification model developed using XGBoost technique had the
highest prediction accuracy for an adverse fetal outcome. Lay health-care workers
in low- and middle-income countries can use this model to triage pregnant women
in remote areas for early referral and further management.

    EMBO Mol Med. 2019 Dec;11(12):e11502.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiac genetic disease accompanied by
structural and contractile alterations. We identified a rare c.740C>T (p.T247M)
mutation in ACTN2, encoding α-actinin 2 in a HCM patient, who presented with left
ventricular hypertrophy, outflow tract obstruction, and atrial fibrillation. We
generated patient-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and show 
that hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and engineered heart tissues recapitulated
several hallmarks of HCM, such as hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray,
hypercontractility, impaired relaxation, and higher myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity,
and also prolonged action potential duration and enhanced L-type Ca2+ current.
The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker diltiazem reduced force amplitude, relaxation,
and action potential duration to a greater extent in HCM than in isogenic
control. We translated our findings to patient care and showed that diltiazem
application ameliorated the prolonged QTc interval in HCM-affected son and sister
of the index patient. These data provide evidence for this ACTN2 mutation to be
disease-causing in cardiomyocytes, guiding clinical therapy in this HCM family.
This study may serve as a proof-of-principle for the use of hiPSC for
personalized treatment of cardiomyopathies.

missense mutations in HRAS. There is little literature describing health concerns
specific to adults with CS. Parents of individuals with CS need to know what to
anticipate as their children age. We surveyed a group of 20 adults and older
adolescents with CS regarding their medical concerns and lifestyle
characteristics. We identified several previously undescribed actionable medical 
concerns in adults with CS. First, the high prevalence of anxiety in this cohort 
indicates that screening for anxiety is warranted since this is a treatable
condition that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Second, adults
with CS should be monitored for progressive contractures or other problems that
could decrease mobility. This is especially important in a population that seems 
to have increased risk for osteopenia. Finally, the lack of cancer diagnoses in
adulthood is of interest, although the cohort is too small to draw definitive
conclusions about cancer risk in adults with CS. Ongoing follow-up of the current
cohort of adults with CS is necessary to delineate progressive medical and
physical problems, which is essential for providing targeted management
recommendations and anticipatory guidance to families.

angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) in detecting ischemia in
myocardial bridging (MB) has not been investigated to date.
METHODS: This retrospective multicentre study included 104 patients with left
anterior descending MBs. MB was classified as either superficial or deep, short, 
or long, whereas all MB vessels were further divided into <50%, 50% to 69%, and
≥70% groups, according to proximal lumen stenosis on invasive coronary
angiography. Diagnostic performance and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
of CT-FFR to detect lesion-specific ischemia was assessed on a per-vessel level, 
using invasive FFR as reference standard. Intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were used for agreement measurement.
RESULTS: Forty-eight MB vessels (46.2%) showed ischemia by invasive FFR (≤0.80). 
Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT-FFR to detect functional ischemia
were 0.96 (0.85 to 0.99), 0.84 (0.71 to 0.92), and 0.89 (0.81 to 0.94),
respectively, in all MB vessels. There were no differences in diagnostic
performance between superficial and deep MB or between short and long MB (all P >
0.05). The accuracy of CT-FFR was 0.96 (0.85 to 0.99) in ≥70% stenosis, 0.82
(0.67 to 0.91) in 50% to 69% stenosis, and 0.89 (0.51 to 0.99) in <50% stenosis
(P = 0.081). Bland-Altman analysis showed a slight mean difference between CT-FFR
and invasive FFR of 0.014 (95% limit of agreement, -0.117 to 0.145). The ICC was 
0.775 (95% confidence interval, 0.685-0.842, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: CT-FFR demonstrated high diagnostic performance for identifying
functional ischemia in vessels with MB and concomitant proximal atherosclerotic
disease when compared with invasive FFR. However, the clinical use of CT-FFR in
patients with MB needs further study for stronger and more robust results.

heterogeneous syndrome in need of improved classification given its high
morbidity and mortality and few effective treatment options. HFpEF represents an 
ideal setting to examine the utility and feasibility of a precision medicine
approach. This article (based on the 20th annual Feigenbaum Lecture, presented at
the 2019 American Society of Echocardiography Scientific Sessions) describes the 
utility of echocardiography as a ""digital biopsy"" and how deep quantitative
echocardiographic phenotyping, coupled with machine learning, can be used to
identify novel HFpEF phenotypes. The cellular and ultrastructural basis of
abnormal speckle-tracking echocardiography- (STE-) based measurements of cardiac 
mechanics can provide a window into cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. STE-based 
measurements of longitudinal strain can thus inform the extent of myocardial
involvement in patients with HFpEF, which may help to determine responsiveness to
cardiac-specific HF medications. However, classifying the complex, systemic,
multiorgan nature of HFpEF appropriately likely requires more advanced methods.
Using unsupervised machine learning, HFpEF can be classified into three distinct 
phenogroups with differing clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and
outcomes: (1) natriuretic peptide deficiency syndrome; (2) extreme
cardiometabolic syndrome; and (3) right ventricle-cardio-abdomino-renal syndrome.
Each can be probed to determine their biological basis. The goal of improved
classification of HFpEF is to match the right patient with the right treatment,
with the hope of improving the track record of HFpEF clinical trials. This
article emphasizes the central role of echocardiography in advancing precision
medicine and illustrates the integration of basic, translational, clinical, and
population research in echocardiography with the goal of better understanding the
pathobiology of a complex cardiovascular syndrome.

affecting approximately 3-4% of the worldwide population. Pinitol, conservatively
used in ayurvedic medicine, has been shown to disclose an antiinflammatory
effect, hold back the T-helper cells, and postpone cardiovascular diseases. In
the present study we aimed to reveal the effect of D-pinitol on imiquimod
(IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in a mouse model via the nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway genes. In the current study, we found that D-pinitol
ameliorated the skin abrasion and abridged epithelial thickness, inflammation
numbers, and collagen-occupied regions in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice. The
same results (epithelial thickness, inflammation numbers, and collagen-occupied
regions) we achieved in dorsal skin regions. In addition, D-pinitol modified the 
lipid profile and antioxidant enzyme levels, which means that the IMQ-induced
group showed elevated malondialdehyde when compared to D-pinitol. Downregulated
expression of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the IMQ-induced 
group was incomparable with D-pinitol, control, and standard group. Additionally,
inflammatory and NF-kB pathway gene levels in the psoriatic mouse skin, which
includes tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-17A, IL-23,TRAF3, NIK,
IKKα, and RelB, were dramatically increased or decreased by treatment with
D-pinitol. Histological and morphometric studies disclose the efficiency of
D-pinitol. Finally, we found that D-pinitol reserved the TRAF3, NIK, IKKα, and
RelB in the psoriatic skin, signifying that it restrains the commencement of
NF-κB signaling pathways. The present results suggest that D-pinitol could prove 
to have tremendous preventive potential against the treatment and prevention of

condition defined as the abnormal rate of fetal growth. The pathology is a
documented cause of fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In clinical
practice, diagnosis is confirmed at birth and may only be suspected during
pregnancy. Therefore, designing an accurate model for the early and prompt
identification of pathology in the antepartum period is crucial in view of
pregnancy management.
METHODS: We tested the performance of 15 machine learning techniques in
discriminating healthy versus IUGR fetuses. The various models were trained with 
a set of 12 physiology based heart rate features extracted from a single
antepartum CardioTocographic (CTG) recording. The reason for the utilization of
time, frequency, and nonlinear indices is based on their standalone documented
ability to describe several physiological and pathological fetal conditions.
RESULTS: We validated our approach on a database of 60 healthy and 60 IUGR
fetuses. The machine learning methodology achieving the best performance was
Random Forests. Specifically, we obtained a mean classification accuracy of 0.911
[0.860, 0.961 (0.95 confidence interval)] averaged over 10 test sets (10 Fold
Cross Validation). Similar results were provided by Classification Trees,
Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. A features ranking procedure
highlighted that nonlinear indices showed the highest capability to discriminate 
between the considered fetal conditions. Nevertheless, is the combination of
features investigating CTG signal in different domains, that contributes to an
increase in classification accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided validation of an accurate artificially intelligence
framework for the diagnosis of IUGR condition in the antepartum period. The
employed physiology based heart rate features constitute an interpretable link
between the machine learning results and the quantitative estimators of fetal
wellbeing.

increased accumulation of subclinical non-calcified coronary burden by coronary
computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Machine learning algorithms have been
shown to effectively analyze well characterized datasets.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to determine top
predictors of non-calcified coronary burden by CCTA in psoriasis.
METHODS: The analysis included 263 consecutive patients with 62 available
variables from the Psoriasis Atherosclerosis Cardiometabolic Initiative. The
random forest algorithm was utilized to determine top predictors of non-calcified
coronary burden by CCTA. We evaluated our results using linear regression models.
RESULTS: Using the random forest algorithm, the top 10 predictors of
non-calcified coronary burden were: body mass index, visceral adiposity, total
adiposity, apolipoprotein A1, high-density lipoprotein, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, subcutaneous adiposity, small low-density lipoprotein particle and
cholesterol efflux capacity. Linear regression of non-calcified coronary burden
yielded results consistent with our machine learning output.
LIMITATION: We were unable to provide external validation and did not study
cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods identified top predictors of non-calcified
coronary burden in psoriasis. These factors were related to obesity,
dyslipidemia, and inflammation demonstrating that these are important targets to 
treat comorbidities in psoriasis.

myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury and its underlying mechanisms. MI/R
rat model and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cardiomyocytes model were established. 
CK level and LDH activity were detected to evaluate MI/R and H/R injury. Cell
viability was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis
were identified by flow cytometry and autophagy were detected by western blot.
Treatment with TMP significantly reduced CK level and LDH activity and decreased 
myocardial infarct size in MI/R rats. TMP reduced autophagy dysfunction induced
by MI/R. Moreover, TMP treatment decreased H/R-induced injury and attenuated
autophagy dysfunction in cardiomyocytes. Inhibiting autophagic flux with
chloroquine (CQ) decreased the cardioprotection exerted by TMP in vivo and in
vitro. Additionally, the effects of TMP on the modulation of autophagy were
inhibited by LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) in H/R cardiomyocytes. Our findings
suggested TMP exerted cardioprotection against MI/R injury by decreasing Beclin-1
associated autophagy dysfunction through PI3K pathway.

arrhythmia. However, as many cases are asymptomatic, a large proportion of
patients remain undiagnosed until serious complications arise. Efficient,
cost-effective detection of the undiagnosed may be supported by risk-prediction
models relating patient factors to AF risk. However, there exists a need for an
implementable risk model that is contemporaneous and informed by routinely
collected patient data, reflecting the real-world pathology of AF.
METHODS: This study sought to develop and evaluate novel and conventional
statistical and machine learning models for risk-predication of AF. This was a
retrospective, cohort study of adults (aged ≥30 years) without a history of AF,
listed on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from January 2006 to December 
2016. Models evaluated included published risk models (Framingham, ARIC,

RESULTS: Analysis of 2,994,837 individuals (3.2% AF) identified time-varying
neural networks as the optimal model achieving an AUROC of 0.827 vs. 0.725, with

animal in vivo models of myocarditis. The project was prospectively registered
with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42018089336). Primary
outcomes (necrosis, fibrosis and calcification) were meta-analysed with
random-effects modelling. 52 studies were systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis 
was performed compared with untreated controls. In each study, we identified all 
independent comparisons of treatment versus control groups. The pooled weighted
mean difference (WMD) indicated treatment reduced necrosis by 16.9% (71
controlled analyses, 95% CI 13.2-20.7%; P < 0.001), however there was less
evidence of an effect after accounting for publication bias. Treatment led to a
12.8% reduction in fibrosis (73 controlled analyses, 95% CI 7.6-18.0%;
P < 0.001). After accounting for publication bias this was attenuated to 7.8% but
remained significant. Treatment reduced calcification by 4.1% (28 controlled

effect size in all primary endpoints, which was predominantly driven by
differences between drug categories. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the only agents that were effective for both
necrosis and fibrosis, while only ACE inhibitors had a significant effect on

measurements such as area, volume, and ejection fraction. However, the automatic 
LV segmentation in 2D echocardiographic images is a challenging task due to
ill-defined borders, and operator dependence issues (insufficient
reproducibility). U-net, which is a well-known architecture in medical image
segmentation, addressed this problem through an encoder-decoder path. Despite
outstanding overall performance, U-net ignores the contribution of all semantic
strengths in the segmentation procedure. In the present study, we have proposed a
novel architecture to tackle this drawback. Feature maps in all levels of the
decoder path of U-net are concatenated, their depths are equalized, and
up-sampled to a fixed dimension. This stack of feature maps would be the input of
the semantic segmentation layer. The performance of the proposed model was
evaluated using two sets of echocardiographic images: one public dataset and one 
prepared dataset. The proposed network yielded significantly improved results
when comparing with results from U-net, dilated U-net, Unet++, ACNN, SHG, and
deeplabv3. An average Dice Metric (DM) of 0.953, Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 3.49,

myocardial infarction (AMI) have potential limitations. This study aimed to
develop and validate deep-learning-based risk stratification for the mortality of
patients with AMI (DAMI).
METHODS: The data of 22,875 AMI patients from the Korean working group of the
myocardial infarction (KorMI) registry were exclusively divided into 12,152
derivation data of 36 hospitals and 10,723 validation data of 23 hospitals. The
predictor variables were the initial demographic and laboratory data. The
endpoints were in-hospital mortality and 12-months mortality. We compared the
DAMI performance with the global registry of acute coronary event (GRACE) score, 
acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network (ACTION) score, and
the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score using the validation data.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality for the study subjects was 4.4% and 6-month
mortality after survival upon discharge was 2.2%. The areas under the receiver
operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DAMI were 0.905 [95% confidence
interval 0.902-0.909] and 0.870 [0.865-0.876] for the ST elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) and non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients,

predicted 30.9% of patients more accurately than the GRACE score. As secondary
outcome, during the 6-month follow-up, the high risk group, defined by the DAMI, 
has a significantly higher mortality rate than the low risk group (17.1% vs.

endeavor, and advanced monitoring techniques are often required to guide
treatment choices. Given the technical complexity and occasional unavailability
of these techniques, estimation of cardiac function based on clinical examination
is valuable for critical care physicians to diagnose circulatory shock. Yet, the

estimate cardiac function has reduced its accuracy to almost that of ""flipping a 
coin.""
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the decision-making process
underlying estimates of cardiac function of patients acutely admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU) based on current standardized clinical examination
using Bayesian methods.
METHODS: Patient data were collected as part of the Simple Intensive Care
Studies-I (SICS-I) prospective cohort study. All adult patients consecutively
admitted to the ICU with an expected stay longer than 24 hours were included, for
whom clinical examination was conducted and cardiac function was estimated. Using
these data, first, the probabilistic dependencies between the examiners'
estimates and the set of clinically measured variables upon which these rely were
analyzed using a Bayesian network. Second, the accuracy of cardiac function
estimates was assessed by comparison to the cardiac index values measured by
critical care ultrasonography.
RESULTS: A total of 1075 patients were included, of which 783 patients had
validated cardiac index measurements. A Bayesian network analysis identified two 
clinical variables upon which cardiac function estimate is conditionally
dependent, namely, noradrenaline administration and presence of delayed capillary
refill time or mottling. When the patient received noradrenaline, the probability
of cardiac function being estimated as reasonable or good P(ER,G) was lower,
irrespective of whether the patient was mechanically ventilated
(P[ER,G|ventilation, noradrenaline]=0.63, P[ER,G|ventilation, no
noradrenaline]=0.91, P[ER,G|no ventilation, noradrenaline]=0.67, P[ER,G|no
ventilation, no noradrenaline]=0.93). The same trend was found for capillary
refill time or mottling. Sensitivity of estimating a low cardiac index was 26%
and 39% and specificity was 83% and 74% for students and physicians,
respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.53 (95% CI
1.19-1.97) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.95), respectively, overall.
CONCLUSIONS: The conditional dependencies between clinical variables and the
cardiac function estimates resulted in a network consistent with known
physiological relations. Conditional probability queries allow for multiple
clinical scenarios to be recreated, which provide insight into the possible
thought process underlying the examiners' cardiac function estimates. This
information can help develop interactive digital training tools for students and 
physicians and contribute toward the goal of further improving the diagnostic
accuracy of clinical examination in ICU patients.

Medley DO, Santiago C, Nascimento JC.

Object recognition and localization is still a very challenging problem, despite 
recent advances in deep learning (DL) approaches, especially for objects with
varying shapes and appearances. Statistical models, such as an Active Shape Model
(ASM), rely on a parametric model of the object, allowing an easy incorporation
of prior knowledge about shape and appearance in a principled way. To take
advantage of these benefits, this paper proposes a new ASM framework that
addresses two tasks: (i) comparing the performance of several image features used
to extract observations from an input image; and (ii) improving the performance
of the model fitting by relying on a probabilistic framework that allows the use 
of multiple observations and is robust to the presence of outliers. The goal in
(i) is to maximize the quality of the observations by exploring a wide set of
handcrafted features (HOG, SIFT, and texture templates) and more recent DL-based 
features. Regarding (ii), we use the Generalized Expectation-Maximization
algorithm to deal with outliers and to extend the fitting process to multiple
observations. The proposed framework is evaluated in the context of facial
landmark fitting and the segmentation of the endocardium of the left ventricle in
cardiac magnetic resonance volumes. We experimentally observe that the proposed
approach is robust not only to outliers, but also to adverse initialization
conditions and to large search regions (from where the observations are extracted
from the image). Furthermore, the results of the proposed combination of the ASM 
with DL-based features are competitive with more recent DL approaches (e.g. FCN
[1], U-Net [2] and CNN Cascade [3]), showing that it is possible to combine the
benefits of statistical models and DL into a new deep ASM probabilistic
framework.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31670673.pdf

Wright rhizomes is found to be
effective in the therapy of cardiovascular disease. Steroidal saponins make
substantial contribution. Previous study has proposed that methylprotodioscin
(MP) may promote cholesterol efflux by increasing ABCA1 expression. But the other
main saponins ingredients are not referred to. The aim of the present work was to
reveal the effect and mechanism of protodioscin (PD), MP and pseudoprotodioscin
(PPD) on the synthesis-related gene expression of cholesterol and triglycerides. 
MTT assay apoptosis assay with annexin AV-APC and 7-AAD double staining were
performed. MicroRNA assay and qRT-PCR were used to analyze the gene expression
which regulates synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides. Western blot was to
demonstrate the levels of target proteins. Cholesterol efflux assay was executed 
to study the stimulative effect of saponins on cholesterol efflux. In Hep G2
cells, PPD increased ABCA1 protein and mRNA levels, and promoted the effluxion of
ApoA-1-mediated cholesterol. The underlying mechanisms involved that PPD
inhibited SREBP1c and SREBP2 transcription by decreasing microRNA 33a/b levels.
This procedure reciprocally led to the increase of ABCA1 levels. In THP-1
macrophages, PPD showed the similar effect, which reduced HMGCR, FAS and ACC mRNA
levels and promoted low density lipoprotein receptor by decreasing the PCSK9
levels. These studies demonstrated that PPD is a potential agent for cholesterol 
efflux, SREBPs and microRNA 33a/b inhibition, which related to the gene
expression for the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides.

by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and early
onset of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. FH is caused by mutations in
genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR),
apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin 
kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals
not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects 
of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are
encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic
individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease.
Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this
explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these 
subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends
not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular
disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low
HDL-cholesterol, obesity and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk 
can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by
detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins
are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these
medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels.
Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C
in FH patients.

    Lancet. 2019 Nov 16;394(10211):1782-1784.

BACKGROUND: Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension,
with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug 
classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of
comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice.
METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that
enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and
outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while
minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale 
study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three
primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and
stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all
first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three
electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding,
publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large 
set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested.
FINDINGS: Using 4·9 million patients, we generated 22 000 calibrated,
propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes 
across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between
classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary
effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial
infarction (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75-0·95), hospitalisation for heart failure (0·83, 
0·74-0·95), and stroke (0·83, 0·74-0·95) risk while on initial treatment. Safety 
profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes.
INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing
observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence
between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with 
current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics
superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

    Lancet. 2019 Nov 16;394(10211):1806.

We did a global review to synthesise data on the prevalence, harms, and
interventions for stimulant use, focusing specifically on the use of cocaine and 
amphetamines. Modelling estimated the effect of cocaine and amphetamine use on
mortality, suicidality, and blood borne virus incidence. The estimated global
prevalence of cocaine use was 0·4% and amphetamine use was 0·7%, with dependence 
affecting 16% of people who used cocaine and 11% of those who used amphetamine.
Stimulant use was associated with elevated mortality, increased incidence of HIV 
and hepatitis C infection, poor mental health (suicidality, psychosis,
depression, and violence), and increased risk of cardiovascular events. No
effective pharmacotherapies are available that reduce stimulant use, and the
available psychosocial interventions (except for contingency management) had a
weak overall effect. Generic approaches can address mental health and blood borne
virus infection risk if better tailored to mitigate the harms associated with
stimulant use. Substantial and sustained investment is needed to develop more
effective interventions to reduce stimulant use.

might be a more efficient strategy to promote osteogenic differentiation of adult

(CNN) reconstruction for accelerated cardiac MR imaging in the real clinical
context.
Methods: Two CNN architectures, Unet and residual network (Resnet) were evaluated
using quantitative and qualitative assessment by radiologist. Four different loss
functions were also considered: pixel-wise (L1 and L2), patch-wise structural
dissimilarity (Dssim) and feature-wise (perceptual loss). The networks were
evaluated using retrospectively and prospectively under-sampled cardiac MR data.
Results: Based on our assessments, we find that Resnet and Unet achieve similar
image quality but that former requires only 100,000 parameters compared to 1.3
million parameters for the latter. The perceptual loss function performed
significantly better than L1, L2 or Dssim loss functions as determined by the
radiologist scores.
Conclusions: CNN image reconstruction using Resnet yields comparable image
quality to Unet with 10X the number of parameters. This has implications for
training with significantly lower data requirements. Network training using the
perceptual loss function was found to better agree with radiologist scoring
compared to L1, L2 or Dssim loss functions.

Long-term persistence of infection is a critical risk factor for the development 
of HPV-induced malignancies. Through the actions of its oncogenes, HPV evades
host immune responses to facilitate its productive life cycle. In this work, we
discovered a previously unknown function of the HPV16 E5 oncoprotein in the
suppression of interferon (IFN) responses. This suppression is focused on
keratinocyte-specific IFN-κ and is mediated through E5-induced changes in growth 
factor signaling pathways, as identified through phosphoproteomics analysis. The 
loss of E5 in keratinocytes maintaining the complete HPV16 genome results in the 
derepression of IFNK transcription and subsequent JAK/STAT-dependent upregulation
of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) at both the mRNA and protein levels. We
also established a link between the loss of E5 and the subsequent loss of genome 
maintenance and stability, resulting in increased genome integration.IMPORTANCE
Persistent human papillomavirus infections can cause a variety of significant
cancers. The ability of HPV to persist depends on evasion of the host immune
system. In this study, we show that the HPV16 E5 protein can suppress an
important aspect of the host immune response. In addition, we find that the E5
protein is important for helping the virus avoid integration into the host
genome, which is a frequent step along the pathway to cancer development.

Muscle mass loss is associated with weakness, fatigue, and insulin resistance. In
fact, it is predicted that controlling muscle atrophy can reduce morbidity and
mortality associated with diseases such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.
METHODS: We analyzed gene expression data from muscle of mice or human patients
with diverse muscle pathologies and identified LMCD1 as a gene strongly
associated with skeletal muscle function. We transiently expressed or silenced
LMCD1 in mouse gastrocnemius muscle or in mouse primary muscle cells and
determined muscle/cell size, targeted gene expression, kinase activity with
kinase arrays, protein immunoblotting, and protein synthesis levels. To evaluate 
force, calcium handling, and fatigue, we transduced the flexor digitorum brevis
muscle with a LMCD1-expressing adenovirus and measured specific force and
sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in individual fibers. Finally, to explore the
relationship between LMCD1 and calcineurin, we ectopically expressed Lmcd1 in the
gastrocnemius muscle and treated those mice with cyclosporine A (calcineurin
inhibitor). In addition, we used a luciferase reporter construct containing the
myoregulin gene promoter to confirm the role of a LMCD1-calcineurin-myoregulin
axis in skeletal muscle mass control and calcium handling.
RESULTS: Here, we identify LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1) as a positive 
regulator of muscle mass, that increases muscle protein synthesis and fiber size.
LMCD1 expression in vivo was sufficient to increase specific force with lower
requirement for calcium handling and to reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely,
silencing LMCD1 expression impairs calcium handling and force, and induces muscle
fatigue without overt atrophy. The actions of LMCD1 were dependent on
calcineurin, as its inhibition using cyclosporine A reverted the observed
hypertrophic phenotype. Finally, we determined that LMCD1 represses the
expression of myoregulin, a known negative regulator of muscle performance.
Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle LMCD1 expression is reduced in
patients with skeletal muscle disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Our gain- and loss-of-function studies show that LMCD1 controls
protein synthesis, muscle fiber size, specific force, Ca2+ handling, and fatigue 
resistance. This work uncovers a novel role for LMCD1 in the regulation of
skeletal muscle mass and function with potential therapeutic implications.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31666122.pdf

active in macrophages infected with a virulent Mtb mutant encoding a deletion in

These activities are sufficient to restrict attenuated BCG, but not virulent

vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions
both in micro- and macro domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes
may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular
lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be
transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase
the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone
modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key
determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for
prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential
expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful
prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects.
Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA
(epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with
obesity and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation
of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate and apabetalone may offer
useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing 
the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising
molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signaling pathways underlying
the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning
tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV 
risk in these patients. We remark the need of combining epigenetics and advanced 
bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in
diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.

random-effect models were applied in the statistical analyses according to the
heterogeneity. Our analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies, which included 44,411 subjects, were included in our 
analyses. The overall incidence of CVEs in AIs group was 13.02% (95% CI:
8.15-20.17%) and almost all of the high-grade CVEs occurred in patients treated
with AIs. The pooled ORs of CVEs was 0.9940 (95% CI: 0.8545-1.1562). Under
sub-group analysis, the incidence of CVEs related to exemestane was higher than
that of controls (OR = 1.1564, 95% CI: 1.0656-1.2549), but no statistical
differences in risk of CVEs were found in other sub-group analysis. No evidence
of publication bias was found for incidence of CVEs in our meta-analysis by a
funnel plot.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with breast cancer treated with 
AIs do not have a significant risk of developing CVEs in comparison with the
controls, and exemestane might not be considered as the alternative AI to the
breast cancer patients from the perspective of CVEs. Further studies are
recommended to investigate this association and the risk differences among
different tumor types, AIs or treatment regimens.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31665091.pdf

this context, this study uses convolutional neural networks for classifying
(diagnosing) AF, employing electrocardiogram data in a general hospital.
METHODS: Data came from Anam Hospital in Seoul, Korea, with 20,000 unique
patients (10,000 normal sinus rhythm and 10,000 AF). 30 convolutional neural
networks were applied and compared for the diagnosis of the normal sinus rhythm
vs. AF condition: 6 Alex networks with 5 convolutional layers, 3 fully connected 
layers and the number of kernels changing from 3 to 256; and 24 residual networks
with the number of residuals blocks (or kernels) varying from 8 to 2 (or 64 to
2).
RESULTS: In terms of the accuracy, the best Alex network was one with 24 initial 
kernels (i.e., kernels in the first layer), 5,268,818 parameters and the training
time of 89 s (0.997), while the best residual network was one with 6 residual
blocks, 32 initial kernels, 248,418 parameters and the training time of 253 s

METHODS: This study evaluated patients with CAD who had a clinically indicated
coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) and underwent invasive coronary

with third-generation dual-source computed tomography and analyzed with on-site
prototype CT-FFRML software.
RESULTS: We enrolled 40 patients (73% males, mean age 67 ± 12 years) who had
iFR®-measurement and CT-FFRML calculation. The mean calculation time of CT-FFRML 
values was 11 ± 2 min. The CT-FFRML algorithm showed, on per-patient and

mutations in predicting resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in patients
with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), analogous to consumer and commercial
recommender systems in which customers who bought products A and B are likely to 
buy C: patients who have a mutation in gene A and gene B are likely to respond or
not respond to HMAs.
METHODS: We screened a cohort of 433 patients with MDS who received HMAs for the 
presence of common myeloid mutations in 29 genes that were obtained before the
patients started therapy. The association between mutations and response was
evaluated by the Apriori market basket analysis algorithm. Rules with the highest
confidence (confidence that the association exists) and the highest lift
(strength of the association) were chosen. We validated our biomarkers in samples
from patients enrolled in the S1117 trial.
RESULTS: Among 433 patients, 193 (45%) received azacitidine, 176 (40%) received
decitabine, and 64 (15%) received HMA alone or in combination. The median age was
70 years (range, 31 to 100 years), and 28% were female. The median number of
mutations per sample was three (range, zero to nine), and 176 patients (41%) had 
three or more mutations per sample. Association rules identified several genomic 
combinations as being highly associated with no response. These molecular
signatures were present in 30% of patients with three or more mutations/sample
with an accuracy rate of 87% in the training cohort and 93% in the validation

cardiovascular diseases. Assessment of population exposed to environmental noise 
is limited by a lack of routine noise sampling and is critical for controlling
exposure and mitigating adverse health effects. Land use regression (LUR) model

approaches offer opportunities to improve the noise estimations from LUR model.
In this study, we employed random forests (RF) model to estimate environmental
noise levels in five Canadian cities and compared noise estimations between RF
and LUR models. A total of 729 measurements and 33 built environment-related
variables were used to estimate spatial variation in environmental noise at the
global (multi-city) and local (individual city) scales. Leave one out
cross-validation suggested that noise estimates derived from the RF global model 
explained a greater proportion of variation (R2: RF = 0.58, LUR = 0.47) with
lower root mean squared errors (RF = 4.44 dB(A), LUR = 4.99 dB(A)). The
cross-validation also indicated the RF models had better general performance than
the LUR models at the city scale. By applying the global models to estimate noise
levels at the postal code level, we found noise levels were higher in Montreal
and Longueuil than in other major Canadian cities.

heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2), by measuring subtle
color changes on the skin surface using a video camera. For patients in a
hospital ward, the main challenges in the development of continuous and robust
non-contact monitoring techniques are the identification of time periods and the 
segmentation of skin regions of interest (ROIs) from which vital signs can be
estimated. We propose a deep learning framework to tackle these
challenges.APPROACH: This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN)
models. The first network was designed for detecting the presence of a patient
and segmenting the patient's skin area. The second network combined the output
from the first network with optical flow for identifying time periods of clinical
intervention so that these periods can be excluded from the estimation of vital
signs. Both networks were trained using video recordings from a clinical study
involving 15 pre-term infants conducted in the high dependency area of the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK.
MAIN RESULTS: Our proposed methods achieved an accuracy of 98.8% for patient
detection, a mean intersection-over-union (IOU) score of 88.6% for skin
segmentation and an accuracy of 94.5% for clinical intervention detection using
two-fold cross validation. Our deep learning models produced accurate results and
were robust to different skin tones, changes in light conditions, pose variations

such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac
steatosis per se in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present
study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF.
Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) 
were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 mo before the study. Electron
microscopy of the atria of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid
droplets around mitochondrial chains, and five- to ninefold greater atrial
triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared with wild-type (WT) mice.
Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice
than in WT mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in
significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice
than in WT mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-mo-old) mice.
Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated
disks in WT atria but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of
cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical
mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg
atria compared with WT atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase 
in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF
susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated
with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF
in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially
beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31661297.pdf

bay with only modest outcome improvement among many diseases. Digitization with
technologies like Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning algorithms might
address this. Although digital technologies have been successfully applied in
clinical studies the effect on the overall health care system so far was limited.
The regulatory ecosystem or data privacy might be responsible, but other reasons 
may also predominate.
OBJECTIVE: We analyzed how the digitization of the German health care market is
currently perceived among different stakeholders and investigated reasons for its
slow adaption.
METHODS: This was a mixed methods study split into a qualitative Part A using the
conceptual approach of the Grounded Theory and a quantitative Part B using the
Delphi method. For Part A we interviewed experts in the health care system and
converted the results into 17 hypotheses. The Delphi method consisted of an
online survey which was sent to the participants via email and was available for 
three months. For the assessment of the 17 hypotheses, the participants were
given a six-point Likert scale. The participants were grouped into patients,
physicians, and providers of services within the German health care market.
RESULTS: There was a strong alignment of opinions on the hypotheses between
experts (N=21) and survey participants (N=733), with 70.5% overall agreement on
12/17 hypotheses. Physicians demonstrated the lowest level of agreement with the 
expert panel at 88% (15/17) disagreement, with the hypotheses ""H8: Digitization
in the health care system will free up jobs,"" and ""H6: Digitization in the health
care system will empower the patients,"" perceived to be in profound disagreement 
(P=.036 and P<.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the firm agreement among participants and experts regarding 
the impact of digitization on the health care system, physicians demonstrated a
more negative attitude. We assume that this might be a factor contributing to the
slow adoption of digitization in practice. Physicians might be struggling with
changing power structures, so future measures to transform the market should
involve them to a larger degree.

pharyngitis) to severely invasive (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis). Strain- and
serotype-specific differences influence the ability of isolates to cause
individual diseases. At the center of this variability is the CovR/S
two-component system and the accessory protein RocA. Through incompletely defined
mechanisms, CovR/S and RocA repress the expression of more than a dozen
immunomodulatory virulence factors. Alleviation of this repression is selected
for during invasive infections, leading to the recovery of covR, covS or rocA
mutant strains. Here, we investigated how RocA promotes CovR/S activity,
identifying that RocA is a pseudokinase that interacts with CovS. Disruption of
CovS kinase or phosphatase activities abolishes RocA function, consistent with
RocA acting through the modulation of CovS activity. We also identified, in
conflict with a previous study, that the RocA regulon includes the secreted
protease-encoding gene speB. Finally, we discovered an inverse correlation
between the virulence of wild-type, rocA mutant, covS mutant and covR mutant
strains during invasive infection and their fitness in an ex vivo upper
respiratory tract model. Our data inform on mechanisms that control GAS disease
potential and provide an explanation for observed strain- and serotype-specific
variability in RocA function.

with incident cardiovascular disease events in primary prevention samples.
However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.
METHODS: We studied 458 men without known cardiovascular disease who participated
in the cardiovascular disease substudy of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and
had cardiac CT angiography. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression 
models to examine the cross-sectional associations between coronary artery
stenosis, coronary artery plaque, indexed left ventricular mass (LVMi), and the
outcome of hs-cTnI. We also evaluated the associations between HIV serostatus or 
use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and hs-cTnI.
RESULTS: The mean age was 54 years, 54% were white, and 61% were HIV infected. In
multivariable-adjusted logistic models, comparing the highest quartile of LVMi
with the lowest quartile, the odds ratio (OR) of hs-cTnI ≥75th percentile was
2.59 (95% CI, 1.20-5.75). There was no significant association between coronary
stenosis severity or plaque type and hs-cTnI in linear models; however, in
logistic regression models, coronary artery stenosis ≥70% (8% of sample) was
marginally associated with a higher likelihood (OR, 2.75 [95% CI, 1.03, 7.27]) of

serostatus or HAART use and hs-cTnI in either linear or logistic models.
CONCLUSION: Among primary prevention men with or at risk for HIV, hs-cTnI
concentrations were strongly associated with LVMi but were not associated with
HIV infection or treatment status or with coronary plaque type or stenosis until 
the extremes of severity (≥70% stenosis).

American Indians (AIs). For patients with severe disease requiring coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG), AIs have been demonstrated to present with
increased risk factors. Guideline-directed medical therapy after CABG effectively
reduces mortality and recurrent ischemic events in all patients and is especially
important in high-risk populations such as AIs. Methods: Isolated CABG patients
between 2012 and 2017 were studied and 74 AI patients were identified. Propensity
matching was performed and the resulting 148 patients were followed for a year
after surgery. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for secondary prevention
of atherosclerotic disease after CABG was detailed in all patients. Results: GDMT
was similar between groups (85% AI vs. 89% non-AI; p=NS), and the incidence of
prescribed antiplatelet medications, beta-blockers, and statins was similar. AIs 
were more likely to receive insulin therapy (p=0.002) and opioids (p=0.03) at
discharge, while non-AIs were more likely to receive anti-arrhythmic medications 
(p=0.002). One year after discharge, GDMT trended lower in AIs (75% AI vs. 85%
non-AI; p=0.2) and AIs were less likely to be on a statin 1 year after surgery
(81% AI vs. 93% non-AI; p=0.04). Opioid use trended higher after 1 year in AIs
(28% AI vs. 18% non-AI; p=NS) and fewer AI patients participated in cardiac
rehabilitation (CR) after CABG. Conclusions: Disparities in GDMT for secondary
prevention of coronary artery disease after CABG exist, with fewer AI patients
receiving statins and undergoing CR 1 year after surgery. Increased use of
opioids in AIs is troubling and deserves further investigation. Improved
adherence to GDMT would be expected to improve long-term outcomes after CABG in
this high risk population.

are a common impairing condition in men aged 50 years and older. In the
management of LUTS related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), medication,
particularly by α-adrenoceptor antagonists, 5α-reductase inhibitors, and
phytopharmaceuticals, is considered the first-line therapy. Despite their
popularity, a number of adverse effects on the cardiovascular or cognitive
systems have been reported for some of the synthetic drugs. One of the promising 
herbal preparations for the treatment of patients suffering from LUTS related to 
BPH is WS PRO 160 I 120 mg, a combination of sabal fruit extract and urtica root 
extract.
Methods: This review of the literature summarizes clinical evidence for WS PRO
160 I 120 mg derived from four randomized placebo- or reference-controlled
double-blind clinical trials including men aged 50 years and older. In all
trials, symptomatic improvement was evaluated by the International Prostate
Symptom Score (I-PSS) total score.
Results: Treatment effects of WS PRO 160 I 120 mg were shown to be superior over 
placebo and comparable with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride or the
α1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin with more favorable tolerability and safety
profiles as compared with the reference drugs.
Conclusions: The results suggest WS PRO 160 I 120 mg to be considered as a valid 
alternative in the treatment of patients with early BPH, especially with view to 
sexual function and a good quality of life, especially in long-term use.

(fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels patients were classified
into one of the following four categories: as euthyroid subjects, as or patients 
affected by hypothyroidism, low T3 (LT3) syndrome or hyperthyroidism. During
follow-up, death for all causes was assessed as primary end-point, whereas time
to the first hospitalization for heart failure worsening was the secondary
end-point analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 762 patients, 190 patients were affected by hypothyroidism (Hypo).
LT3 syndrome was diagnosed in 15 patients and 59 patients were affected by
hyperthyroidism (Hyper). During a long term follow-up (5.1±3.7 years), 303
patients died. Patients with Hypo showed an increased risk of death as well as of
hospitalization due to heart failure worsening at univariate regression analysis.
At multivariate regression analysis Hypo remained associated with hospitalization
after correction for age >75 years, ischemic aetiology, diabetes, therapy with
ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, therapy with betablockers and with aldosterone
antagonists, NYHA class 3, systolic arterial pressure <95 mmHg, left ventricular 
ejection fraction <30%, estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min,
hyponatremia and NT-proBNP>1000 pg/ml. At, multivariate analysis, the independent
association with death was significant only for the subgroup of patients with TSH
>10 mIU/L. LT3 was independently associated with both heart failure
hospitalization and death, whereas Hyper was not associated with any of the two
considered end-points.
CONCLUSION: Hypo is associated with a worse prognosis over a long-term follow-up.
The association with heart failure hospitalization is not dependent on the
baseline TSH levels, whereas the association with death is significant only when 
TSH >10 mIU/L. Finally, Hyper does not have anly association with a worse
prognosis.

increased cardiovascular death, which is driven by hypertension, diabetes,
obesity, and dyslipidemia. These should be evaluated before and after active
hypercortisolism, and each should be treated specifically. Antihypertensives may 
be chosen based on probable pathophysiology. Thus, inhibitors of the
renin-angiotensinogen system are recommended. Mineralocorticoid antagonists are
helpful in hypokalemic patients. Other agents are often needed to normalize blood
pressure. If medical treatment of Cushing syndrome is chosen, the goal should be 
to normalize cortisol (or its clinical action); if this is not achieved, it is
more difficult to treat comorbidities.

valve (BAV) has been posed to be a risk factor for the dilation of the pulmonary 
autograft in the aortic position. The aim of this study is to assess the
association between the subtype of native aortic valve leaflet fusion (right and 
noncoronary leaflets [R/N] vs right and left leaflets [R/L]) and autograft
dilation and valve dysfunction after the Ross procedure.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 43 patients with BAV who
underwent a Ross procedure in our center from 1993 to 2013. Serial transthoracic 
echocardiography was used to measure changes in autograft and ascending aortic
diameter over time. The aortic diameter was measured at four levels, and Z values
were computed. Aortic dilation was defined as a Z value greater than 3.
RESULTS: The mean age at the time of the Ross procedure was 13.5 ± 9.2 years. R/L
was the most prevalent native aortic valve subtype (R/L, n = 26, 61% vs R/N,
n = 17, 39%). PreRoss procedure, aortic dilation was more frequent in patients
with R/N fusion (P = .02), whereas the initial aortic valve gradient and grade of
aortic insufficiency (AI) did not differ between the subgroups. At follow-up,
(mean = 9.6 ± 4.3 years) dilation of the autograft and ascending aorta was seen
more often in patients with R/N leaflet fusion (P = .03). Conversely, the
prevalence of more than moderate AI was significantly higher in patients with R/L
leaflet fusion (P = .03). There was no significant difference between groups
among numbers of late reintervention on the aortic valve or root (P = .75);
however the type of intervention varied by morphologic subtype. Patients with R/L
fusion underwent more aortic valve replacements (AVRs) while patients with R/N
fusion underwent more valve-sparing aortic root replacements.
CONCLUSIONS: After Ross procedure, both groups of patients were likely to have a 
combination of dilation of the aortic root and the tubular portion of the
ascending aorta at follow-up. Patients with R/L fusion were more likely to have a
prevalence of root dilation, while patients with R/N fusion were more likely to
have tubular ascending aorta dilation. The R/L phenotype is associated with a
slightly more rapid dilation at follow-up and is more likely to have
postoperative autograft insufficiency. This information may serve to guide
patient and procedure selection for AVR.

heterozygous mutations in KMT2D or KDM6A, genes encoding a lysine-specific
methyltransferase or demethylase, respectively. The phenotype is highly variable,
including congenital cardiac and renal anomalies, developmental delay, hypotonia,
failure to thrive, short stature, and immune dysfunction. All affected
individuals have characteristic facial features. As KS natural history has not
been fully delineated, limited information exists on its prenatal and perinatal
history. Two tertiary centers collected retrospective data from individuals with 
KS (N = 49) using a questionnaire followed by review of medical records. Data
from 49 individuals (age range: 7 months-33 years; 37% male; 36 with KMT2D
mutations, 2 with KDM6A mutations, and 11 diagnosed clinically) were examined.
Polyhydramnios affected 16 of 39 (41%) pregnancies. Abnormal quad screens in four
out of nine (44%) pregnancies and reduced placental weights also complicated KS
pregnancies. These data comprise the first large dataset on prenatal and
perinatal history in individuals with confirmed (genetically or clinically) KS.
Over a third of pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios, possibly
secondary to abnormal craniofacial structures and functional impairment of
swallowing. The differential diagnosis for polyhydramnios in the absence of
intrauterine growth retardation should include KS.

structuring several informative variables for predictive tasks. Here, we
investigated how ML algorithms may assist in echocardiographic pulmonary
hypertension (PH) prediction, where current guidelines recommend integrating
several echocardiographic parameters.
METHODS: In our database of 90 patients with invasively determined pulmonary
artery pressure (PAP) with corresponding echocardiographic estimations of PAP
obtained within 24 hours, we trained and applied five ML algorithms (random
forest of classification trees, random forest of regression trees, lasso
penalized logistic regression, boosted classification trees, support vector
machines) using a 10 times 3-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme.
RESULTS: ML algorithms achieved high prediction accuracies: support vector
machines (AUC 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.93), boosted classification trees (AUC 0.80;
95% CI 0.68-0.92), lasso penalized logistic regression (AUC 0.78; 95% CI
0.67-0.89), random forest of classification trees (AUC 0.85; 95% CI 0.75-0.95),
random forest of regression trees (AUC 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.96). In contrast to
the best of several conventional formulae (by Aduen et al.), this ML algorithm is
based on several echocardiographic signs and feature selection, with estimated
right atrial pressure (RAP) being of minor importance.
CONCLUSIONS: Using ML, we were able to predict pulmonary hypertension based on a 
broader set of echocardiographic data with little reliance on estimated RAP
compared to an existing formula with non-inferior performance. With the
conceptual advantages of a broader and unbiased selection and weighting of data
our ML approach is suited for high level assistance in PH prediction.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31652290.pdf

myelokathexis, or WHIMs) is a very rare autosomal dominant immunodeficiency
disorder attributable to mutations in CXCR4. We reviewed clinical manifestations 
in 24 patients in 9 families to expand understanding of this syndrome.
RECENT FINDINGS: Warts, cellulitis and respiratory infections are common in
patients with WHIMs. Less commonly these patients have congenital heart disease, 
human papilloma virus-associated malignancies (cervical and vulvular) and
lymphomas. Hearing loss because of recurrent otitis media is another important
complication. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is
controversial; this review indicates that it is effective to prevent and treat
infections based upon long-term observations of patients enrolled in the Severe
Chronic Neutropenia International Registry. Understanding the natural history and
diversity of this syndrome are important for ongoing clinical trials of novel
agents to treat WHIMs.
SUMMARY: WHIM syndrome has diverse manifestations; some features occur
consistently in almost all patients, for example, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia
and mild hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the clinical consequences are quite
variable across patient cohorts and within families. Each complication is
important as a cause for morbidity and a source for patient and family concerns.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31652152.pdf

However, the usage, dosage and course of treatment of glucocorticoid in irAEs are
different from those in classic autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, long-term use of

treatment strategies of malignant tumors, which has become a milestone in cancer

releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some

reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful
applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond
the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including
agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors,
thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put
some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the
secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge
during steroid treatment. We propose the ""De-escalation Therapy"" principle for
severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs
specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs 
in the era of immunotherapy are unprecedented compared with traditional
chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to
oncologists. Therefore, the establishment of multidisciplinary system is very
important for the management of cancer patients.

analyses of histological images. With advancement in the field of machine
learning, such steps can be automated using computer vision methods. This paper
presents an ensemble-based approach for improved classification of
non-pathological tissues and organs in histological images using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). With limited dataset size, we relied upon transfer
learning where pre-trained CNNs are re-used for new classification problems. The 
transfer learning was done using eleven CNN architectures upon 6000 image patches
constituting training and validation subsets of a public dataset containing six
cardiovascular categories. The CNN models were fine-tuned upon a much larger
dataset obtained by augmenting training subset to obtain agreeable performance on
validation subset. Lastly, we created various ensembles of trained classifiers
and evaluate them on testing subset of 7500 patches. The best ensemble classifier
gives, precision, recall, and accuracy of 0.876, 0.869 and 0.869, respectively
upon test images. With an overall F-score of 0.870, our ensemble-based approach
outperforms previous approaches with single fine-tuned CNN, CNN trained from

respectively. Ensemble approach can perform better than individual
classifier-based ones, provided the constituent classifiers are chosen wisely.
The empirical choice of classifiers reinforces the intuition that models which
are newer and outperformed in their native domain are more likely to outperform
in transferred-domain, since the best ensemble dominantly consists of more lately

world, its negative outcomes for pregnant women and newborns necessitate to
predict preterm birth and identify its main risk factors. Premature deliveries
have been divided into provider-initiated (with medical intervention for early
terminating the pregnancy) and spontaneous preterm birth (without any
intervention) categories in the previous studies. The main aim of this study is
proposing methods for prediction of provider-initiated preterm birth and
spontaneous premature deliveries and ranking the predictive features.
METHODS: Data from national databank of Maternal and neonatal records (IMAN
registry) is used in the study. The collected data have information about more
than 1,400,000 deliveries with 112 features. Among them, 116,080 preterm births
have occurred (from which 11,799 and 104,281 cases belong to provider-initiated
preterm birth and spontaneous premature delivery, respectively). The data can be 
considered as big data due to its large number of data records, large number of
the features and unbalanced distribution of the data between three classes of
term, provider-initiated and spontaneous preterm birth. Therefore, we need to
analyze data based on big data algorithms. In this paper, Map Reduce-based
machine learning algorithms named MR-PB-PFS are proposed for this purpose. Map
phase use parallel feature selection and classification methods to score the
features. Reduce phase aggregates the feature scores obtained in Map phase and
assign final scores to the features. Moreover, the classifiers trained in Map
phase are aggregated based on two different ensemble rules in Reduce phase.
RESULTS: Experimental results show that the best performance of the proposed
models for preterm birth prediction is accuracy of 81% and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 68%. Top features for predicting
term, provider-initiated preterm and spontaneous premature birth identified in
this study are having pregnancy risk factors, having gestational diabetes, having
cardiovascular disease, maternal underlying diseases, and mother age. Chronic
blood pressure is a high rank feature for preterm birth prediction and father
nationality is highly important for discriminating provider-initiated from
spontaneous premature delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the pregnant women with high risk of spontaneous
premature or therapeutic preterm delivery in our proposed model can help them to:
(1) reduce the probability of premature birth with monitoring and management of
the main risk factors and/or (2) educate them to care from the premature newborn.
Management and monitoring top features discriminating term, provider-initiated
preterm and spontaneous premature birth or their associated factors can reduce
preterm labor or its negative outcomes.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31650230.pdf

features and β-amyloid (Aβ) burden in the brain with the aim of developing a
noninvasive method to predict the deposition of Aβ in the brain of patients with 
Alzheimer's disease.
Methods: Retinal images from 20 cognitively impaired and 26 cognitively
unimpaired cases were acquired (3 images per subject) using a hyperspectral
retinal camera. The cerebral amyloid status was determined from binary reads by a
panel of 3 expert raters on 18F-florbetaben positron-emission tomography (PET)
studies. Image features from the hyperspectral retinal images were calculated,
including vessels tortuosity and diameter and spatial-spectral texture measures
in different retinal anatomical regions.
Results: Retinal venules of amyloid-positive subjects (Aβ+) showed a higher mean 
tortuosity compared with the amyloid-negative (Aβ-) subjects. Arteriolar diameter
of Aβ+ subjects was found to be higher than the Aβ- subjects in a zone adjacent
to the optical nerve head. Furthermore, a significant difference between texture 
measures built over retinal arterioles and their adjacent regions were observed
in Aβ+ subjects when compared with the Aβ-. A classifier was trained to
automatically discriminate subjects combining the extracted features. The
classifier could discern Aβ+ subjects from Aβ- subjects with an accuracy of 85%.
Discussion: Significant differences in texture measures were observed in the
spectral range 450 to 550 nm which is known as the spectral region known to be
affected by scattering from amyloid aggregates in the retina. This study suggests
that the inclusion of metrics related to the retinal vasculature and
tissue-related textures extracted from vessels and surrounding regions could
improve the discrimination performance of the cerebral amyloid status.

While many agents have been developed to aid in weight loss, few have withstood
critical assessment of safety and efficacy. Weight loss agents are held to a
higher standard for safety and tolerability than medications for other
conditions, because they are often used by otherwise healthy individuals driven
more by concerns over appearance than health. Furthermore, all weight loss
medications should be used as a part of a coordinated weight loss program that
includes modification of behaviors, a reduced calorie diet and increased physical
activity or exercise. Currently used drugs for weight loss can be separated into 
those that suppress appetite (such as diethylpropion and phentermine) and those
that block absorption of calories (orlistat). The anoxeric agents currently used 
for weight loss are largely sympathomimetic agents (amphentamine,
diethylproprion, and phentermine). Other classes of drugs that can affect
appetite, but which are not all specifically approved for weight loss, include
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion, fenfluramine,
fluoxetine), serotonin agonists (lorcaserin), GABAergic agents (topiramate,
zonisamide) and cannabinoid antagonists (rimonabant). Sibutamine is unusual in
having both sympathomimetic activity as well as blocking serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake. Sibutamine was withdrawn from use in the United States
in 2010 because of concerns over increased risks for cardiovascular adverse
events including myocardial infarction and stroke. In 2012, two weight loss
agents were approved for use in the United States: a combination of phentermine
and topiramate (Qsymia) and a serotonin agonist (Lorcaserin: Belviq). More
recently, two new agents were approved: the first, a fixed dose combination of
the antidepressant bupropion and the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone which 
is marketed under the name Contrave; the second, the injectable glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist liraglutide which is approved and used for type 2
diabetes (Victoza) was also approved for the additional indication of weight loss
(Saxenda). Drugs that suppress appetite generally affect appetite centers in the 
central nervous system (CNS) and can have other CNS effects such as nervousness, 
excitability, insomnia, mood changes, and headache. Drugs that affect absorption 
of nutrients often have other gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea,
flatulence and abdominal bloating. Liver injury is rare with all of the currently
approved medications for weight loss. In contrast, serious hepatotoxicity has
been linked to several over the counter and herbal preparations promoted as
helping with weight loss (usnic acid, ephedra, Plethoryl).

Antihypertensive medications are some of the most important and commonly used
drugs in medical practice. Hypertension affects at least 50% of persons over the 
age of 60 and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality from
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. More than 50 medications are used in 
the therapy of hypertension. The drugs can be categorized into seven major
classes: (1) diuretics, (2) sympatholytic drugs, (3) calcium channel blockers,
(4) angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, (5) angiotensin II receptor
antagonists/blockers [ARBs], (6) direct renin antagonists, and (7) various
vasodilators. Overall, the antihypertensive agents are rare causes of drug
induced liver injury, the exceptions being two agents that have been in use for
more than 50 years and are now not commonly used: methyldopa and hydralazine. The
other antihypertensive drugs have been linked to drug induced liver injury only
in isolated case reports and are rarely listed in large case series of acute
liver failure or clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice due to
medications.

Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is marked by proliferation of vasculature and
remodeling of small pulmonary arteries which causes an increase in pulmonary
vascular resistance. The resultant pulmonary artery hypertension can lead to
right heart failure and death. Both endothelial and smooth muscle cells appear to
play a role in the development and progression of PAH. The underlying cause of
most cases of PAH is unknown, but some cases are associated with autoimmune
diseases such as scleroderma or systemic sclerosis. PAH is also a complication of
chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema and interstitial
lung diseases such as sarcoidosis. Agents used for PAH, however, are largely
effective in patients with idiopathic forms of this condition who do not have
major structural damage to the lungs (secondary PAH). Pharmacotherapy of PAH has 
recently advanced with the development of specific antagonists and inhibitors of 
receptors and pathways involved in the modulation of smooth muscle tone in the
pulmonary vasculature. Three major classes of agents are used: prostaglandins,
endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
Prostacyclin is a prostaglandin that is produced by endothelial cells in the
lungs and directly relaxes the smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vasculature. 
In idiopathic PAH, there is reduced production of prostacyclin. Stable analogues 
of prostacyclin have been developed which can be given by infusion or inhalation 
and result in temporary decrease in pulmonary artery pressure.

The angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs), are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin 
II type 1 receptor (AT1) and thus inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and its
cascade of effects in causing arteriolar contraction and sodium retention. While 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin 
I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs 
inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as
well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used 
widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of
hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in
clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical
structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan
(Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996), irbesartan (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan
(Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998),
olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents
have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during
chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self
limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the
ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute liver injury that is
usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being
usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common
presentation of liver injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis
arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping.
Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute liver
failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of
clinically apparent liver injury have been published in the literature for
losartan, valsartan, irbesartan olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically 
for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have
been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and
particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like
enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight
loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 
months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological
findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal
villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and
endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and 
there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB,
however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of 
duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had
accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and fatty liver by imaging or
liver biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the
medication.

density (BMD) over the first 1-2 years. Whether this loss continues with longer
therapy is unclear. We determined changes in bone and spine BMD over 5 years in
adults receiving immediate or deferred initial ART.
METHODS: In the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) BMD substudy, 
ART-naïve adults with CD4 counts > 500 cells/μL were randomized to immediate or
deferred ART. Deferred group participants not yet on ART were offered ART after
May 2015. Mean per cent changes in total hip and lumbar spine BMD (measured
annually by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were compared between groups using 
longitudinal mixed models. Fracture rates were also compared between groups for
all START participants.
RESULTS: Substudy participants (immediate group, n = 201; deferred group,
n = 210; median age 32 years; 80% non-white; 24% female) were followed for a mean
4.5 years until December 2016. In the immediate group, > 96% used ART throughout.
In the deferred group, 16%, 58% and 94% used ART at years 1, 3 and 5,
respectively. BMD decreased more in the immediate group initially; groups had
converged by year 3 at the spine and year 4 at the hip by intent-to-treat (ITT). 
BMD changes after year 1 were similar in the immediate group and in those off ART
in the deferred group [mean difference: spine, 0.03% per year; 95% confidence
interval (CI) -0.4, 0.4; P = 0.88; hip, -0.2% per year; 95% CI -0.7, 0.3;
P = 0.37]. Fracture incidence did not differ significantly between groups
(immediate group, 0.86/100 person-years versus deferred group, 0.85/100
person-years; hazard ratio 1.01; 95% CI 0.76, 1.35; P = 0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant ART-induced bone loss slowed after the first year of ART
and became similar to that in untreated HIV infection.

the effectiveness of first-line anti-hypertensive treatment combining 2 out of
the following classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blocker (A), calcium channel blocker (C), and
thiazide-type diuretics (D).
METHODS: Treatment-naïve hypertensive adults without cardiovascular disease (CVD)
who initiated dual anti-hypertensive medications were identified in 5 databases
from US and Korea. The patients were matched for each comparison set by
large-scale propensity score matching. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. 
Myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events as a composite outcome comprised the secondary measure.
RESULTS: A total of 987,983 patients met the eligibility criteria. After
matching, 222,686, 32,344, and 38,513 patients were allocated to A+C vs. A+D, C+D
vs. A+C, and C+D vs. A+D comparison, respectively. There was no significant
difference in the mortality during total of 1,806,077 person-years: A+C vs. A+D
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.20; p=0.127), C+D

ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) combined with measurement of
contextual factors to identify hypertensive phenotypes in a Caribbean population 
with high rates of HTN and cardiovascular disease.
Design: Prospective, multi-center sub-study.
Setting: Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network Cohort (ECHORN)
Study, with study sites in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Trinidad and
Tobago, and Barbados.
Participants: Community-residing adults without a diagnosis of HTN and not taking
antihypertensive medication.
Intervention: Ambulatory BP patterns are assessed using 24-hour ABPM. Contextual 
factors are assessed with: ecological momentary assessment (7-item survey of
experiences, exposures and responses associated with daytime BP measurements);
actigraphy (capturing physical activity and sleep quality); and self-report
surveys (assessing physical and social health, environmental and social stressors
and supports).
Main Outcome Measures: Phenotypes of contextual factors associated with
hypertensive BP patterns (sustained HTN, masked HTN, and nocturnal non-dipping).
Methods and Results: This study will enroll 500 participants; assessments of
blood pressure and contextual factors will be conducted during Waves 2 and 3 of
the ECHORN parent study, occurring 2 years apart. In Wave 2, we will assess the
association between contextual factors and ABPM patterns. Using advanced analytic
clustering methods, we will identify phenotypes of contextual factors associated 
with hypertensive ABPM patterns. We will then test the stability of these
phenotypes and their ability to predict change in ABPM patterns between Waves 2
and 3.
Conclusions: Assessment of ABPM, and the contextual factors influencing ABPM, can
identify unique phenotypes of HTN, which can then be used to develop more
precision-based approaches to the prevention, detection and treatment of HTN in
high-risk populations.

maturing into their resting follicular B cell successors. We found that metabolic
quiescence was acquired at the follicular B cell stage in both humans and mice.
In follicular B cells, the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis,
aerobic respiration, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
signaling was reduced when compared to that in transitional B cells. Functional
metabolism studies, profiling of whole-cell metabolites, and analysis of cell
surface proteins in human B cells suggested that this transition was also
associated with increased extracellular adenosine salvage. Follicular B cells
increased the abundance of the cell surface ectonucleotidase CD73, which
coincided with adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
activation. Differentiation to the follicular B cell stage in vitro correlated
with surface acquisition of CD73 on human transitional B cells and was augmented 
with the AMPK agonist, AICAR. Last, individuals with gain-of-function PIK3CD
(PI3Kδ) mutations and increased pS6 activation exhibited a near absence of
circulating follicular B cells. Together, our data suggest that mTORC1
attenuation may be necessary for human follicular B cell development. These data 
identify a distinct metabolic switch during human B cell development at the
transitional to follicular stages, which is characterized by an induction of
extracellular adenosine salvage, AMPK activation, and the acquisition of
metabolic quiescence.

to improve the classification performance for supraventricular ectopic beat
(SVEB) and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB).
METHODS: The ECG signals were preprocessed by heartbeat segmentation and
heartbeat alignment. An arrhythmia classifier was constructed based on
convolutional neural network, and the proposed loss function was used to train
the classifier.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was verified on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The 
AUC of the proposed loss function for SVEB and VEB reached 0.77 and 0.98,
respectively. With the first 5 min segment as the local data, the diagnostic
sensitivities for SVEB and VEB were 78.28% and 98.88%, respectively; when 0, 50, 
100, and 150 samples were used as the local data, the diagnostic sensitivities
for SVEB and VEB reached 82.25% and 93.23%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method effectively reduces the negative impact of

due to increasing resistance to antibiotics. As a facultative intracellular
pathogen, MRSA is capable of persisting within professional phagocytes including 
macrophages. Here, we identify a role for CASP11 in facilitating MRSA survival
within murine macrophages. We show that MRSA actively prevents the recruitment of
mitochondria to the vicinity of the vacuoles they reside in to avoid
intracellular demise. This process requires CASP11 since its deficiency allows
increased association of MRSA-containing vacuoles with mitochondria. The
induction of mitochondrial superoxide by antimycin A (Ant A) improves MRSA
eradication in casp11-/- cells, where mitochondria remain in the vicinity of the 
bacterium. In WT macrophages, Ant A does not affect MRSA persistence. When
mitochondrial dissociation is prevented by the actin depolymerizing agent
cytochalasin D, Ant A effectively reduces MRSA numbers. Moreover, the absence of 
CASP11 leads to reduced cleavage of CASP1, IL-1β, and CASP7, as well as to
reduced production of CXCL1/KC. Our study provides a new role for CASP11 in
promoting the persistence of Gram-positive bacteria.

mixed-data cohort of individuals with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) using unsupervised clustering analysis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included all Treatment of Preserved Cardiac
Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) participants from 
the Americas (n = 1767). In the subset of participants with available
echocardiographic data (derivation cohort, n = 654), we characterized three
mutually exclusive phenogroups of HFpEF participants using penalized finite
mixture model-based clustering analysis on 61 mixed-data phenotypic variables.
Phenogroup 1 had higher burden of co-morbidities, natriuretic peptides, and
abnormalities in left ventricular structure and function; phenogroup 2 had lower 
prevalence of cardiovascular and non-cardiac co-morbidities but higher burden of 
diastolic dysfunction; and phenogroup 3 had lower natriuretic peptide levels,
intermediate co-morbidity burden, and the most favourable diastolic function
profile. In adjusted Cox models, participants in phenogroup 1 (vs. phenogroup 3) 
had significantly higher risk for all adverse clinical events including the
primary composite endpoint, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalization.
Phenogroup 2 (vs. phenogroup 3) was significantly associated with higher risk of 
HF hospitalization but a lower risk of atherosclerotic event (myocardial
infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death), and comparable risk of mortality.
Similar patterns of association were also observed in the non-echocardiographic
TOPCAT cohort (internal validation cohort, n = 1113) and an external cohort of
patients with HFpEF [Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status
and Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RELAX)
trial cohort, n = 198], with the highest risk of adverse outcome noted in
phenogroup 1 participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based cluster analysis can identify phenogroups of 
patients with HFpEF with distinct clinical characteristics and long-term
outcomes.

treatment patterns in clinical practice, especially in France.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the treatment initiation patterns and the subsequent
treatment changes among HF patients, in the first year following an incident
hospitalization for HF, in a French real-world setting.
METHODS: A cohort of patients aged ≥ 40 years, with an incident hospitalization
for HF between 01/01/2008 and 31/12/2013, was identified in the 1/97th permanent 
random sample of the French nationwide claims database and followed 1 year. HF
drug exposure-beta blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

diuretics, digoxin, or ivabradine-was assessed quarterly using a Proportion of
Days Covered ≥ 66% (≥ 60 days out of the 90 days of the quarter), by considering 
HF drugs individually or in combination. Drug changes were assessed between each 
quarter.
RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2013, 7387 patients were included. Their mean age was
77.7 years (± 12.0 years) and 51.6% were women. During the follow-up, 24.4% died,
20% were not exposed to any HF treatment, 48.3 to 43.2% had diuretics, one third 
had BB or ACEI, 9% had ARB or AA, 6% had digoxin, and 2% had ivabradine. The main
change occurred between the first and the second quarter for 53.1% of the

recommended indication of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with New York
Heart Association (NYHA) classes II-III appears to be higher than one would
expect based on the drug-induced variations of the left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF). More thorough investigations with the use of indicators of
longitudinal systolic function have been therefore recommended to verify whether 
a part of the clinical improvement achieved with the use of sacubitril/valsartan 
could be supported by a reverse remodeling ensuing from changes other than a
simple LVEF increase.
Methods: In the present retrospective cohort study, which collected the pertinent
data from two centers devoted to clinical management of outpatients with CHF and 
dating back to the years 2017 and 2018, we separated patients treated with
sacubitril/valsartan from those treated with conventional medical therapy,
including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor 
blockers (ARBs). For the rest, the therapies practiced in the two groups,
patients under sacubitril/valsartan and controls, were almost identical,
including similar doses of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists (MRAs) in the two cohorts, plus loop diuretics, with the latter
administered at variable doses. The endpoints were the variations of LVEF and
global left ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS) over a study period not shorter
than 1 year.
Results: One hundred thirty-two patients were collected within our retrospective 
cohort study, of whom 44 were treated with sacubitril/valsartan and 88 were
subjected to conventional therapy. All patients were marked by heart failure with
reduced (LVEF ≤ 40%) left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF). The mean
duration of the retrospective observation period was 14 ± 3 months. In controls, 
LVEF was improved after a year of therapy from 38.071 ± 5.445% (mean ± standard
deviation) to 41.595 ± 5.282%. On the contrary, no significant improvement in the
controls could be identified for the GLS, from -12.059 ± 4.016% to -12.250 ±
4.287%. In analogy with controls, patients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan
showed a significant increase in LVEF after 1 year of treatment from 39.714 ±
4.789% to 42.119 ± 5.683% (P < 0.001). However, differently from the controls,
sacubitril/valsartan group exhibited a significant improvement in GLS from
-10.142 ± 3.080% to -18.238 ± 7.284% (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The present retrospective cohort study demonstrated that the use of 
sacubitril/valsartan for HFREF patients, extended for a mean duration of 14
months, yields a significant improvement in the echocardiographic parameters of
systolic function along the transverse (LVEF) and longitudinal (GLS) axis. For
the GLS in particular, a clear superiority emerges in comparison with
conventional therapy including ACE inhibitor or ARBs. From these data, the
hypothesis could be derived of a possible useful role of sacubitril/valsartan
also for the therapy of HFpEF. In this regard, more exhaustive clarifications
ensuing from the ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are eagerly awaited.

Planes.

Quality control / assessment of ultrasound (US) images is an essential step in
clinical diagnosis. This process is usually done manually, suffering from some
drawbacks, such as dependence on operator's experience and extensive labors, as
well as high inter- and intra-observer variation. Automatic quality assessment of
US images is therefore highly desirable. Fetal US cardiac four-chamber plane
(CFP) is one of the most commonly used cardiac views, which was used in the
diagnosis of heart anomalies in the early 1980s. In this paper, we propose a
generic deep learning framework for automatic quality control of fetal US CFPs.
The proposed framework consists of three networks: (1) a basic CNN (B-CNN),
roughly classifying four-chamber views from the raw data; (2) a deeper CNN
(D-CNN), determining the gain and zoom of the target images in a multi-task
learning manner; and (3) the aggregated residual visual block net (ARVBNet),
detecting the key anatomical structures on a plane. Based on the output of the
three networks, overall quantitative score of each CFP is obtained, so as to
achieve fully automatic quality control. Experiments on a fetal US dataset
demonstrated our proposed method achieved a highest mean average precision (mAP) 
of 93.52% at a fast speed of 101 frames per second (FPS). In order to demonstrate
the adaptability and generalization capacity, the proposed detection network
(i.e., ARVBNet) has also been validated on the PASCAL VOC dataset, obtaining a
highest mAP of 81.2% when input size is approximately 300×300.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31634851.pdf

syndrome (ACS). Practice patterns of ACS management by HIV serostatus are
unknown. We examined the presentation and management of ACS in PLWH.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
METHODS: We included 86 PLWH and 263 sex-matched and race-matched HIV-negative
controls hospitalized with ACS between 2004 and 2013. We performed multivariable 
conditional logistic regression to determine the associations between HIV
serostatus and ACS type and management.
RESULTS: Both groups were predominantly of black race and male sex. PLWH were
significantly younger (53 vs. 60 years) and more likely to smoke (48 vs. 31%).
Among PLWH, 30% had CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl and 58% had
undetectable HIV RNA. PLWH had more single-vessel disease and a higher median
Gensini score among those with single-vessel disease (32 vs. 4.25) than controls.
HIV serostatus was positively associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (95% confidence interval (CI)):5.05
(1.82-14.02)], and any revascularization procedure after ACS [aOR (95% CI): 2.90 
(1.01-8.39)] and negatively associated with non-STEMI [aOR (95% CI): 0.33

likelihood of bare metal stent placement compared with controls [70 vs. 15%, aOR 
(95% CI): 5.94 (1.33-26.55)]. Among PLWH, ACS characteristics were not
significantly associated with CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, or antiretroviral therapy.
CONCLUSION: PLWH hospitalized with ACS were more likely to have severe
single-vessel disease, present with STEMI rather than non-STEMI, and undergo
revascularization, and less likely to have a drug-eluting stent placed than
matched HIV-negative controls, suggesting that coronary plaque morphology and/or 
distribution is different with HIV infection and warrants further investigation.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31634195.pdf

cirrhosis at the intensive care units (ICUs) and associated with increased
mortality. The aim of our research was to explore the epidemiology and risk
factors of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 975 patients with cirrhosis were selected into 
our study, and all participants were followed up for at least 28 days. Cox
regression model and machine-learning algorithm were used to identify the
importance of different risk factors, respectively. Finally, an improved
prognostic model as Model for End-stage Liver Disease and metabolic acidosis
(MELD-MA) was developed.
RESULTS: Among the 975 patients with liver cirrhosis, 506 had metabolic acidosis,
including 257 patients who had decompensated metabolic acidosis at ICU admission.
The 28-day mortality was 41% (206/506) in patients with metabolic acidosis.
Bilirubin (hazard ratio (HR): 1.023, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.011-1.036), 
international normalized ratio (HR: 1.527, 95% CI: 1.332-1.750), pH (HR: 0.173,
95% CI: 0.047-0.640), BE-Lac (HR: 0.907, 95% CI: 0.868-0.948), and BE-Na (HR:
0.923, 95% CI: 0.859-0.991) were considered as independent prognostic parameters 
for 28-day mortality. MELD-NA had significantly higher discrimination (area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79) than MELD and Child-Pugh score.
CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with cirrhosis have a high mortality rate and
poor prognosis because of the high prevalence of metabolic acidosis. Lactic
acidosis is the worst prognosis of all types of metabolic acidosis. MELD-MA
performs well on the short-term mortality assessment in critically ill patients
with cirrhosis and metabolic acidosis.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31633484,Nan

characteristics of NVAF patients in relation to treatment.
Design: A retrospective cohort study in a ""real-world"" setting.
Setting: Data were analysed by integrating administrative databases that included
approximately 2,000,000 individuals assisted by the National Health System from
two Italian Local Health Units.
Participants: All adult patients with at least one hospital discharge or ≥2
outpatient visits with a diagnosis code for NVAF from 1/01/2011 to 31/12/2015
were included.
Main outcome measures: Anticoagulation treatment patterns, health care resource
use and major bleeding events that occurred during the follow-up period were
evaluated.
Results: 32,863 NVAF patients were included, of whom 7,831 had at least one
prescription of oral anticoagulants. Among them, 6,876 patients were vitamin K
antagonists (VKA) users and 955 were non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant 
(NOAC) users at index date (ID). During the follow-up period, the use of
antiplatelet drugs was higher among VKA-naïve users than the NOAC-naïve users.
Among NOAC users, 76.1% showed an adherence level ≥80% during follow-up. The rate
of bleeding events resulted higher for VKA patients compared to NOAC patients.
The unadjusted incidence rate was 10.46 per 1000 person-year for VKA patients and
4.55 per 1,000 person-years for NOAC patients. The overall annual cost (in term
of drugs, hospitalisations and outpatient specialist services) was € 5,156.13 for
VKA and € 4,630.57 for NOAC.
Conclusion: This unselected cohort study, on NVAF patients being prescribed oral 
anticoagulants, highlights that VKA was largely prescribed and the great majority
of patients on NOACs were adherent to treatment. Most of the OAC patients still
received antiplatelet agents in combination, and in NOAC patients, we registered 
a lower number of bleeding events compared with VKA.

(Fujita Med J 2015; 1(1): 9-14) developed a method to
simultaneously obtain both coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and CT
myocardial perfusion (CTP) using 64-multi detector CT (MDCT). An input-function
(time enhancement curve, TEC) of the ascending aorta (Ao) and myocardial CT
density are necessary to calculate absolute myocardial blood flow (ml/g/min)
using a two-compartment model. Helical scan starting timing is important to
capture the peak (P) of Ao time enhancement curve (TEC). The purpose is to search
the optimal timing of starting helical scan to capture the P.
METHODS: We performed 14 CTPs using Definition AS+ (SIEMENS). A dynamic scan at
the Ao level was started at 7 s after contrast injection and helical scan was
started at various trigger on bolus tracking. Definition AS+ needs 2 s (other
scanner may need 4 s) for changing from a dynamic to helical scan mode. We
created TECs of pulmonary artery (PA) and Ao using the fifth function fitting. We
measured the time from trigger point to the P (t200, t250, t300 and tCP).
RESULTS: Mean t200, t250, t300 and tCP were 9.1±1.9, 7.9±2.0, 6.6±1.9 and 3.9±1.2
s, respectively. In additional other 16 CTP studies using the cross point method,
we can capture the P in all (100%) examinations.
CONCLUSION: Scan starting at the cross point is best for Definition AS+, and the 
Ao=300 HU may be best for other scanner that needs 4 s for changing scan mode to 
obtain a fine input function for calculating absolute myocardial blood flow.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31631107.pdf

patients, elevated troponin is associated with increased mortality. However, due 
to concerns of cerebral hypoperfusion and hemorrhagic transformation, current
practice has been slow to apply proven cardiac therapies to these patients. This 
study aims to determine this rate of utilization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center review of 83 patients with AIS and
measured troponin was conducted. Patients were stratified based on elevated and
non-elevated troponin. Between groups, we measured the utilization of
evidence-based cardiac therapies and used a univariate logistic regression to
compare outcomes of mortality, re-hospitalization, recurrent acute ischemic
stroke, recurrent acute myocardial infarction, and a composite of these outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 83 patients, 25 had elevated troponin and 58 had non-elevated
troponin. There was no statistical difference in the use of cardiac therapies
between the two groups. Adenosine diphosphate P2Y12 antagonists were infrequently
used in both elevated and non-elevated troponin groups at 32% vs. 24% (p = 0.64),
as were Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARB) at 56% vs. 69% (p = 0.38). Those in the elevated troponin
group encountered a statistically significant increase in composite endpoint 64% 
vs. 33% (Odds Ratio [OR] 7.28, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.19-28.88, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Cardiac therapies are underutilized in patients with acute ischemic
stroke and elevated troponin levels. In turn, this low usage may explain the
increase in morbidity and mortality seen in these patients and the use of such
therapies should be considered when treating this subset of patients as the
cardio protective nature of these therapies may outweigh the risks associated
with them in AIS patients.

or activated protein C (aPC) differentially regulate the quiescence and bone
marrow (BM) retention of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Murine HSC co-express
THBD, PAR1, and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), suggesting that HSC
sustain quiescence in a quasi-cell autonomous manner due to the binding of
thrombin present in the microenvironment to THBD, activation of EPCR-bound
protein C by the thrombin-THBD-complex, and subsequent activation of PAR1 by the 
aPC-EPCR complex.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of THBD expression on HSC for sustaining stem
cell quiescence and BM retention under homeostatic conditions.
METHODS: Hematopoietic stem cell function was analyzed in mice with constitutive 
or temporally controlled complete THBD-deficiency by flow cytometry, functional
assays, and single cell RNA profiling.
RESULTS: THBD was expressed in mouse, but not human, HSC, progenitors, and
immature B cells. Expression in vascular endothelium was conserved in humans' BM.
Mice with constitutive THBD deficiency had a normal peripheral blood profile,
altered BM morphology, reduced numbers of progenitors and immature B cells,
pronounced extramedullary hematopoiesis, increased HSC frequency, and marginally 
altered transcriptionally defined HSC stemness. Transplantation experiments
indicated near normal engraftment and repopulating ability of THBD-deficient HSC.
Transgenic aPC supplementation normalized BM histopathology and HSC abundance,
and partially restored transcriptional stemness, but had no effect on B cell
progenitors and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Temporally controlled THBD gene
ablation in adult mice did not cause the above abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: THBD expression on HSPC has minor effects on homeostatic
hematopoiesis in mice, and is not conserved in humans.

radiation, are known to induce cardiovascular complications. Currently, the
increase of cancer therapies will involve new mechanisms such as cancer
immunotherapies, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4
inhibitors). These treatments have shown long-term remissions in subgroup of
cancers, including melanomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and colorectal
cancer. Although these treatments will change the natural course of these
cancers, they may sometimes induce cardiovascular complications, which has been
reported as about 1 % in the literature. Currently, the physicians must keep in
mind one uncommon but severe cardiac complication: auto-immune myocarditis. The
clinical presentation may include various symptoms like chest pain, heart failure
or rhythm disorders. In this situation, a baseline cardiologic check-up before
starting cancer immunotherapy may be very helpful. Cardiac biomarkers (troponin
and brain natriuretic peptide) and 12-lead resting electrocardiogram must be
promptly performed when myocarditis is suspected. A cardiologist's opinion must
be requested in emergency to discuss both a transthoracic echocardiography and
the appropriate treatment (stopping immunotherapy, adding immunosuppressive
treatment such as corticoids) and the monitoring in an intensive care unit.
Cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsies may help to approach the final diagnosis.
In this situation, other cancer therapies may be discussed.

emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to
help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence
features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3,
which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the
second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low
signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time
of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new
actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called 
PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control
units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better 
precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of
new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The 
improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of
the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized
emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers

including variable selection (e.g., multivariate adaptive regression splines,

Shockable arrhythmia
can be terminated with device electrical shock therapies. Ventricular-tachycardia
(VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are responsive to electrical
anti-tachycardia pacing therapy and defibrillation which help to restore normal
electrical and mechanical function of the heart. In contrast, non-shockable
arrhythmia like asystole and bradycardia are not responsive to electric shock
therapy. Distinguishing between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia is an
important diagnostic challenge that has practical clinical relevance. It is
difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of arrhythmia by
manual inspection of electrocardiogram (ECG) segments within the short time
duration before triggering the device for electrical therapy. Automated
defibrillators are equipped with automatic shockable arrhythmia detection
algorithms based on ECG morphological features, which may possess variable
diagnostic performance depending on machine models. In our work, we have designed
a robust system using wavelet decomposition filter banks for extraction of
features from the ECG signal and then classifying the features. We believe this
method will improve the accuracy of discriminating between shockable and
non-shockable arrhythmia compared with existing conventional algorithms. We used 
a novel three channel orthogonal wavelet filter bank, which extracted features
from ECG epochs of duration 2 s to distinguish between shockable and
non-shockable arrhythmia. The fuzzy, Renyi and sample entropies are extracted
from the various wavelet coefficients and fed to support vector machine (SVM)
classifier for automated classification. We have obtained an accuracy of 98.9%,
sensitivity and specificity of 99.08% and 97.11.9%, respectively, using 10-fold
cross validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic has been
found to be 0.99 with F1-score of 0.994. The system developed is more accurate
than the existing algorithms. Hence, the proposed system can be employed in
automated defibrillators inside and outside hospitals for emergency revival of
patients suffering from SCD. These automated defibrillators can also be implanted
inside the human body for automatic detection of potentially fatal shockable
arrhythmia and to deliver an appropriate electric shock to the heart.

Although simple lipid
quantification is routinely used, plasma lipids are rarely investigated at the
level of individual molecules. We aimed at predicting different measures of
obesity based on the plasma lipidome in a large population cohort using advanced 
machine learning modeling. A total of 1,061 participants of the FINRISK 2012
population cohort were randomly chosen, and the levels of 183 plasma lipid
species were measured in a novel mass spectrometric shotgun approach. Multiple
machine intelligence models were trained to predict obesity estimates, i.e., body
mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat
percentage (BFP), and validated in 250 randomly chosen participants of the Malmö 
Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC). Comparison of the different
models revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best (R2 = 0.73), based on a 
Lasso model. In this model, the strongest positive and the strongest negative
predictor were sphingomyelin molecules, which differ by only 1 double bond,
implying the involvement of an unknown desaturase in obesity-related aberrations 
of lipid metabolism. Moreover, we used this regression to probe the clinically
relevant information contained in the plasma lipidome and found that the plasma
lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, because WHR (R2 =
0.65) was predicted more accurately than BMI (R2 = 0.47). These modeling results 
required full resolution of the lipidome to lipid species level, and the
predicting set of biomarkers had to be sufficiently large. The power of the
lipidomics association was demonstrated by the finding that the addition of
routine clinical laboratory variables, e.g., high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- or
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol did not improve the model further.
Correlation analyses of the individual lipid species, controlled for age and
separated by sex, underscores the multiparametric and lipid species-specific
nature of the correlation with the BFP. Lipidomic measurements in combination

recommended indication of patients with reduced (<40%) left ventricular ejection 
fraction (HFrEF) belonging to NYHA classes II-III appears to be higher than that 
one would expect based on the drug-induced variations of the left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF). More thorough investigations with the use of indicators
of longitudinal systolic function have been therefore recommended, to verify
whether a part of the clinical improvement achieved with the use of
sacubitril/valsartan might be supported by a reverse remodeling ensuing from
changes other than a simple LVEF increase.
METHODS: In the present retrospective cohort study, which collected the pertinent
data from two centers devoted to clinical management of outpatients with CHF and 
dating back to the years 2017 and 2018, we separated patients treated with
sacubitril/valsartan from those treated with conventional medical therapy,
including ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). For the 
rest, the therapies practiced in the two cohorts - patients under
sacubitril/valsartan and controls - were almost identical, including similar
doses of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), plus
loop diuretics, the latter administered at variable doses depending on the signs 
and symptoms of congestion. The endpoints were the variations of LVEF and global 
left ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS) over a study period not shorter than
one year.
RESULTS: Patients collected within our retrospective cohort study were 132, of
whom 44 treated with sacubitril/valsartan and 88 subjected to conventional
therapy. All patients were marked by heart failure with reduced (LVEF<40%) left
ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF). The mean duration of the retrospective
observation period was 14±3 months. In the controls, LVEF was improved after one 
year of therapy - from 38.071±5.445% (mean±SD) to 41.595±5.282%; P=0.003. On the 
contrary, no significant improvement in the controls was identified for the GLS -
from -12.059±4.016% to -12.250±4.287%; P=0.406. In analogy with controls,
patients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan showed a significant increase in LVEF
after one year of treatment - from 39.714±4.789% to 42.119±5.683%- (P<0.001).
However, differently from the controls, sacubitril/valsartan group exhibited a
significant improvement in GLS - from -10.142±3.080% to -18.238±7.284%; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present retrospective cohort study demonstrates that the use of 
sacubitril/valsartan for HFREF patients, extended for a mean duration of 14
months, yields a significant improvement in the echocardiographic parameters of
systolic function along the transverse (LVEF)and longitudinal (GLS) axes. For the
GLS in particular a clear superiority emerges in comparison with conventional
therapy including ACE-i or ARBs. From this data the hypothesis of a possible
useful role of sacubitril/valsartan also for the therapy of HFpEF could be
derived. In this regard, more exhaustive clarifications ensuing from the ongoing 
randomized controlled trials are eagerly awaited.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31625704,Nan

We retrospectively identified 204 consecutive patients with an ejection fraction

ventricular strain parameters were obtained. Additionally, regional wall motion
abnormality, 13 electrocardiographic (ECG) features and six demographic features

derivation and a validation cohort. Using the parameters retrieved, logistic
regression and ANN models were developed in the derivation cohort to
differentiate ischaemic from non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the models were then
tested in the validation cohort. Results. A final strain-based ANN model, full
feature ANN model and full feature logistic regression model were developed and
validated, F1 scores were 0.82, 0.79 and 0.63, respectively. Conclusions. Both
ANN models were more accurate at predicting cardiomyopathy type than the logistic
regression model. The strain-based ANN model should be validated in other

sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As
feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based
techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in
beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature
extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques
mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed 
in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the
performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification
and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a
prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single
biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the
accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the
multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher
classification accuracy gain.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31623279.pdf

identification of important genetic factors that may contribute to the adverse

monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. New strategies for improving the care of
patients receiving antipsychotic medications are proposed. As it is now possible 
to evaluate the risk of SCD in patients on antipsychotic medications,
preventative measures and close monitoring may be used to detect the early signs

is often linked to allergy. A systems perspective may prove helpful in
unravelling the complexity of asthma and allergy. Our aim is to give an overview 
of systems biology approaches used in allergy and asthma research. Specifically, 
we describe recent ""omic""-level findings, and examine how these findings have
been systematically integrated to generate further insight.Current research
suggests that allergy is driven by genetic and epigenetic factors, in concert
with environmental factors such as microbiome and diet, leading to early-life
disturbance in immunological development and disruption of balance within key
immuno-inflammatory pathways. Variation in inherited susceptibility and exposures
causes heterogeneity in manifestations of asthma and other allergic diseases.
Machine learning approaches are being used to explore this heterogeneity, and to 
probe the pathophysiological patterns or ""endotypes"" that correlate with
subphenotypes of asthma and allergy. Mathematical models are being built based on
genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data to predict or discriminate disease
phenotypes, and to describe the biomolecular networks behind asthma.The use of
systems biology in allergy and asthma research is rapidly growing, and has so far
yielded fruitful results. However, the scale and multidisciplinary nature of this
research means that it is accompanied by new challenges. Ultimately, it is hoped 
that systems medicine, with its integration of omics data into clinical practice,
can pave the way to more precise, personalised and effective management of
asthma.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and
disease burden worldwide, causing 1 in 7 deaths in the United States alone. Risk 
prediction models that can learn the complex causal relationships that give rise 
to CAD from data, instead of merely predicting the risk of disease, have the
potential to improve transparency and efficacy of personalized CAD diagnosis and 
therapy selection for physicians, patients, and other decision makers. Methods.
We use Bayesian networks (BNs) to model the risk of CAD using the Z-Alizadehsani 
data set-a published real-world observational data set of 303 Iranian patients at
risk for CAD. We also describe how BNs can be used for incorporation of
background knowledge, individual risk prediction, handling missing observations, 
and adaptive decision making under uncertainty. Results. BNs performed on par
with machine-learning classifiers at predicting CAD and showed better probability
calibration. They achieved a mean 10-fold area under the receiver-operating

cardiovascular system, with direct effects on cardiac function, vascular system, 
and atherosclerotic factors. Epicardial adipose tissue, the visceral fat of the
heart, has emerged as a new cardiometabolic risk marker because of its close
anatomical proximity to the myocardium and coronary artery. This study aimed to
evaluate epicardial fat thickness (EFT) in children with subclinical
hypothyroidism (SH) and its relation to early atherosclerotic changes.
METHODS: The study included 32 children with SH due to autoimmune thyroiditis and
32 healthy children matched for age and gender as control group. Patients and
controls underwent anthropometric evaluation and measurement of fasting lipids,
glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). TSH, free thyroxine (FT4 and FT3)
and antithyroid autoantibodies (antithyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin
antibodies) were also measured. Conventional echo-cardiography was used to assess
EFT. Noninvasive ultrasound was used to measure carotid intima-media thickness
and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) responses.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients had higher atherogenic index (AI) and
hs-CRP (p = 0.001 for each). Conventional echocardiography revealed that patients
with SH had higher EFT (p = 01) and significantly lower FMD response compared
with the control (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, EFT values were
significantly correlated with TSH (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.04-1.34; p = 0.01), hs-CRP
(OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; p = 0.001, AI (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.17-2.03; p = 0.001),
and FMD response (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.14-2.53; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that EFT is higher in children with SH
compared with controls and associated with FMD responses. Measurement of EFT by
echocardiography in children with SH may help to identify those at high risk of
developing subclinical atherosclerosis.

Rapid endothelialization, antithrombosis and antiproliferation approaches are
suitable for dispelling these complications. Nevertheless, common antithrombosis 
and antiproliferation techniques are usually incompatible with rapid
endothelialization on vascular grafts. To overcome these obstacles, we developed 
nanofibrous polyurethane scaffolds loaded with resveratrol drug, which is a
natural compound extracted from plants and shows multifaceted effects in
cardiovascular protection. It was found that the tensile strength and Young's
modulus in modified scaffolds were significantly increased by resveratrol loading
into membranes. The tensile strengths and breaking strains of resveratrol-loaded 
scaffolds were close to that of native vessels. The resveratrol release profile
from the nanofibrous scaffolds occurred in a sustained manner. The
anti-thrombogenicity of resveratrol-loaded nanofibers increased compared to
polyurethane alone, with the result that prolonged human blood clotting time and 
lower hemolysis were detected on these scaffolds. The viability of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells on resveratrol-loaded
scaffolds was evaluated. Our findings demonstrated that resveratrol-loaded
nanofibers resulted in not only appropriate antithrombotic properties, but the
formation of a monolayer of endothelial cells on the scaffold surface and lower
smooth muscle cell growth. These resveratrol-loaded nanofibers are suggested as

can sense and adapt to a wide variety of environments within the human host, in
part through its 16 two-component regulatory systems. The ArlRS two-component
system has been shown to affect many cellular processes in S. aureus, including
autolysis, biofilm formation, capsule synthesis and virulence. Yet the molecular 
details of this regulation remained largely unknown. We used RNA sequencing to
identify the ArlRS regulon, and found 70% overlap with that of the global
regulator MgrA. These genes included cell wall-anchored adhesins (ebh, sdrD),
polysaccharide and capsule synthesis genes, cell wall remodeling genes (lytN,
ddh), the urease operon, genes involved in metal transport (feoA, mntH, sirA),
anaerobic metabolism genes (adhE, pflA, nrdDG) and a large number of virulence
factors (lukSF, lukAB, nuc, gehB, norB, chs, scn and esxA). We show that ArlR
directly activates expression of mgrA and identify a probable ArlR-binding site
(TTTTCTCAT-N4 -TTTTAATAA). A highly similar sequence is also found in the spx P2 
promoter, which was recently shown to be regulated by ArlRS. We also demonstrate 
that ArlS has kinase activity toward ArlR in vitro, although it has slower
kinetics than other similar histidine kinases.

prediction performance requires further improvement. To improve the performance
of predicting VF, we used the QRS complex shape features, and traditional HRV
features were also used for comparison. We extracted features from 120-s-long HRV
and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals (QRS complex signed area and R-peak
amplitude) to predict the VF onset 30 s before its occurrence. Two artificial
neural network (ANN) classifiers were trained and tested with two feature sets
derived from HRV and the QRS complex shape based on a 10-fold cross-validation.
The prediction accuracy estimated using 11 HRV features was 72%, while that
estimated using four QRS complex shape features yielded a high prediction
accuracy of 98.6%. The QRS complex shape could play a significant role in
performance improvement of predicting the occurrence of VF. Thus, the results of

tremendous impact on lesion progression and plaque stability. Because macrophages
in atherosclerotic plaques express angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), current
dogma posits that local myeloid-mediated effects worsen the disease. In contrast,
we previously reported that myeloid ACE overexpression augments macrophage
resistance to various immune challenges, including tumors, bacterial infection
and Alzheimer's plaque deposition. Here, we sought to assess the impact of
myeloid ACE on atherosclerosis.
METHODS: A mouse model in which ACE is overexpressed in myelomonocytic lineage
cells, called ACE10, was generated and sequentially crossed with ApoE-deficient
mice to create ACE10/10ApoE-/- (ACE10/ApoE). Control mice were ACEWT/WTApoE-/-
(WT/ApoE). Atherosclerosis was induced using an atherogenic diet alone, or in
combination with unilateral nephrectomy plus deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)
salt for eight weeks.
RESULTS: With an atherogenic diet alone or in combination with DOCA, the
ACE10/ApoE mice showed significantly less atherosclerotic plaques compared to
their WT/ApoE counterparts (p < 0.01). When recipient ApoE-/- mice were
reconstituted with ACE10/10 bone marrow, these mice showed significantly reduced 
lesion areas compared to recipients reconstituted with wild type bone marrow.
Furthermore, transfer of ACE-deficient bone marrow had no impact on lesion area.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that while myeloid ACE may not be required for
atherosclerosis, enhanced ACE expression paradoxically reduced disease
progression.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) are used
extensively for treating life-threatening conditions such as bradycardia,
atrioventricular block and heart failure. The complicated heterogeneous physical 
dynamics of patients provide distinct challenges to device development and
validation. We address this problem by proposing a device testing framework
within the in-silico closed-loop context of patient physiology.
METHODS: We develop an automated framework to validate CIEDs in closed-loop with 
a high-level physiologically based computational heart model. The framework
includes test generation, execution and evaluation, which automatically guides an
integrated stochastic optimization algorithm for exploration of physiological
conditions.
CONCLUSION: The results show that using a closed loop device-heart model
framework can achieve high system test coverage, while the heart model provides
clinically relevant responses. The simulated findings of pacemaker mediated
tachycardia risk evaluation agree well with the clinical observations.
Furthermore, we illustrate how device programming parameter selection affects the
treatment efficacy for specific physiological conditions.

testing of CIEDs into their design provides important indications of safety and
efficacy under constrained physiological conditions.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31613786.pdf

correlation between native T1 and T2 values, EDTH, and PSWT were evaluated.
RESULTS: Native T1 and T2 values were significantly elevated in both
non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic segments of HCM patients compared to controls
(both p < 0.001). PSWT was preserved in non-hypertrophic segments (p = 0.838),
while significantly impaired (p < 0.001) in hypertrophic segments. Native T1
value of severe hypertrophic segments in HCM was significantly higher than
segments of mild and moderate hypertrophy (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In HCM patients, the non-hypertrophic myocardial segments already
demonstrated significantly elevated T1 and T2 values, despite normal wall
thickness and preserved contraction function. The finding suggests that tissue
remodeling may precede morphological and functional remodeling in HCM. MRI native
T1 and T2 mapping can provide additional value for HCM diagnosis at an early
stage.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Myocardial tissue remodeling, as detected by MRI native T1
and T2 mapping, occurs earlier than morphological and functional changes in HCM
patients.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31613647.pdf

The Future is Already Here.,"There is currently no other hot topic like the ability of current technology to
develop capabilities similar to those of human beings, even in medicine. This
ability to simulate the processes of human intelligence with computer systems is 
known as artificial intelligence (AI). This article aims to clarify the various
terms that still sound foreign to us, such as AI, machine learning (ML), deep
learning (DL), and big data. It also provides an in-depth description of the
concept of AI and its types; the learning techniques and technology used by ML;
cardiac imaging analysis with DL; and the contribution of this technological
revolution to classical statistics, as well as its current limitations, legal
aspects, and initial applications in cardiology. To do this, we conducted a
detailed PubMed search on the evolution of original contributions on AI to the
various areas of application in cardiology in the last 5 years and identified 673
research articles. We provide 19 detailed examples from distinct areas of
cardiology that, by using AI, have shown diagnostic and therapeutic improvements,
and which will aid understanding of ML and DL methodology.

conditions on recurrent neural network methods compared with traditional machine 
learning methods.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using longitudinal electronic health record data, we
assessed the relative performance of machine learning models trained to detect a 
future diagnosis of heart failure in primary care patients. Model performance was
assessed in relation to data parameters defined by the combination of different
data domains (data diversity), the number of patient records in the training data
set (data quantity), the number of encounters per patient (data density), the
prediction window length, and the observation window length (ie, the time period 
before the prediction window that is the source of features for prediction). Data
on 4370 incident heart failure cases and 30 132 group-matched controls were used.
Recurrent neural network model performance was superior under a variety of
conditions that included (1) when data were less diverse (eg, a single data
domain like medication or vital signs) given the same training size; (2) as data 
quantity increased; (3) as density increased; (4) as the observation window
length increased; and (5) as the prediction window length decreased. When all
data domains were used, the performance of recurrent neural network models
increased in relation to the quantity of data used (ie, up to 100% of the data). 
When data are sparse (ie, fewer features or low dimension), model performance is 
lower, but a much smaller training set size is required to achieve optimal
performance compared with conditions where data are more diverse and includes
more features.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent neural networks are effective for predicting a future
diagnosis of heart failure given sufficient training set size. Model performance 
appears to continue to improve in direct relation to training set size.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31610714.pdf

there is rising interest to determine if AF severity or burden can further risk
stratify these patients, particularly for near-term events. Using continuous
remote monitoring data from cardiac implantable electronic devices, we sought to 
evaluate if machine learned signatures of AF burden could provide prognostic
information on near-term risk of stroke when compared to conventional risk
scores.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified Veterans Health Administration
serviced patients with cardiac implantable electronic device remote monitoring
data and at least one day of device-registered AF. The first 30 days of remote
monitoring in nonstroke controls were compared against the past 30 days of remote
monitoring before stroke in cases. We trained 3 types of models on our data: (1) 
convolutional neural networks, (2) random forest, and (3) L1 regularized logistic
regression (LASSO). We calculated the CHA2DS2-VASc score for each patient and
compared its performance against machine learned indices based on AF burden in
separate test cohorts. Finally, we investigated the effect of combining our AF
burden models with CHA2DS2-VASc. We identified 3114 nonstroke controls and 71
stroke cases, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Random
forest performed the best in the test data set (area under the curve [AUC]=0.662)
and convolutional neural network in the validation dataset (AUC=0.702), whereas
CHA2DS2-VASc had an AUC of 0.5 or less in both data sets. Combining CHA2DS2-VASc 
with random forest and convolutional neural network yielded a validation AUC of
0.696 and test AUC of 0.634, yielding the highest average AUC on nontraining
data.

effects (ITE) is a challenging task, as confounding inevitably exists in clinical
data. Most of the existing models for ITE estimation tackle this problem by
creating unbiased estimators of the treatment effects. Although valuable,
learning a balanced representation is sometimes directly opposed to the objective
of learning an effective and discriminative model for ITE estimation. We propose 
a novel hybrid model bridging multi-task deep learning and K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) for ITE estimation. In detail, the proposed model firstly adopts multi-task
deep learning to extract both outcome-predictive and treatment-specific latent
representations from Electronic Health Records (EHR), by jointly performing the
outcome prediction and treatment category classification. Thereafter, we estimate
counterfactual outcomes by KNN based on the learned hidden representations. We
validate the proposed model on a widely used semi-simulated dataset, i.e. IHDP,
and a real-world clinical dataset consisting of 736 heart failure (HF) patients. 
The performance of our model remains robust and reaches 1.7 and 0.23 in terms of 
Precision in the estimation of heterogeneous effect (PEHE) and average treatment 
effect (ATE), respectively, on IHDP dataset, and 0.703 and 0.796 in terms of
accuracy and F1 score respectively, on HF dataset. The results demonstrate that
the proposed model achieves competitive performance over state-of-the-art models.
In addition, the results reveal several findings which are consistent with
existing medical domain knowledge, and discover certain suggestive hypotheses
that could be validated through further investigations in the clinical domain.

myocardial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that pleckstrin
homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) is a
cytoprotective protein that protects against various adverse injuries. However,
whether PHLPP2 participates in regulating myocardial-infarction-induced
cardiomyocyte injury remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to
investigate the biological role and molecular mechanism of PHLPP2 in regulating
hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in an
anaerobic chamber for 24 h to induce hypoxic injury in vitro. The expression of
PHLPP2 was determined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis.
Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL
and caspase-3 activity assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
were measured by DCFH-DA probe. PHLPP2 expression was highly upregulated in
hypoxia-injured cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of PHLPP2 by small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated gene silencing significantly improved the viability of
hypoxia-injured cardiomyocytes and attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis and ROS
production. In contrast, PHLPP2 overexpression exacerbated hypoxia-induced
apoptosis and ROS production in cardiomyocytes. Mechanism research revealed that 
PHLPP2 silencing increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase
(GSK)-3β and promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). In addition, PHLPP2 inhibition promoted
Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) transcriptional activity. However, Nrf2
silencing markedly reversed PHLPP2-inhibition-mediated cardioprotection, while
GSK-3β inhibition partially blocked the PHLPP2-overexpression-induced adverse
effect. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PHLPP2 inhibition
alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury by reinforcing Nrf2/ARE
antioxidant signaling via inactivating GSK-3β, a pathway that highlights the
importance of the PHLPP2/GSK-3β/Nrf2/ARE signaling axis in regulation of
cardiomyocyte injury. Our study suggests a potential relevance for PHLPP2 in
acute myocardial infarction, and this protein may serve as a promising target for
cardioprotection.

solution for cardiac segmentation and quantification.
BACKGROUND: Segmentation of cardiac structures from coronary computed tomography 
angiography (CCTA) images is laborious. We designed an end-to-end deep-learning
solution.
METHODS: Scans were obtained from multicenter registries of 166 patients who
underwent clinically indicated CCTA. Left ventricular volume (LVV) and right
ventricular volume (RVV), left atrial volume (LAV) and right atrial volume (RAV),
and left ventricular myocardial mass (LVM) were manually annotated as ground
truth. A U-Net-inspired, deep-learning model was trained, validated, and tested
in a 70:20:10 split.
RESULTS: Mean age was 61.1 ± 8.4 years, and 49% were women. A combined overall
median Dice score of 0.9246 (interquartile range: 0.8870 to 0.9475) was achieved.
The median Dice scores for LVV, RVV, LAV, RAV, and LVM were 0.938 (interquartile 
range: 0.887 to 0.958), 0.927 (interquartile range: 0.916 to 0.946), 0.934
(interquartile range: 0.899 to 0.950), 0.915 (interquartile range: 0.890 to
0.920), and 0.920 (interquartile range: 0.811 to 0.944), respectively. Model
prediction correlated and agreed well with manual annotation for LVV (r = 0.98), 
RVV (r = 0.97), LAV (r = 0.78), RAV (r = 0.97), and LVM (r = 0.94) (p < 0.05 for 
all). Mean difference and limits of agreement for LVV, RVV, LAV, RAV, and LVM
were 1.20 ml (95% CI: -7.12 to 9.51), -0.78 ml (95% CI: -10.08 to 8.52), -3.75 ml
(95% CI: -21.53 to 14.03), 0.97 ml (95% CI: -6.14 to 8.09), and 6.41 g
(95% CI: -8.71 to 21.52), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning model rapidly segmented and quantified cardiac
structures. This was done with high accuracy on a pixel level, with good
agreement with manual annotation, facilitating its expansion into areas of
research and clinical import.

diagnosis and management of patients suspected of having a cardiomyopathy. Beyond
functional and anatomical information, multimodality imaging provides important
variables that facilitate risk stratification and prognosis evaluation. Whatever 
the underlying suspected cardiomyopathy, echocardiography is the most common
initial imaging test used to establish the presence of cardiomyopathy, by
depicting structural and functional abnormalities. However, echocardiographic
findings are non-specific, and therefore have a limited role in identifying the
underlying aetiology. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allows characterization 
of myocardial tissue, which can be of great help in identifying the aetiology of 
the cardiomyopathy. When a specific aetiology is suspected, particularly
inflammation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is recommended.
The clinician should be capable of selecting the appropriate imaging techniques
for each clinical scenario. Each technique has strengths and weaknesses, which
should be known. In order to improve diagnostic performance, and as proposed by
the European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging, cardiovascular imaging
groups must be composed of experts from all modalities. The future of
multimodality imaging in the diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies will
also involve evolution of its use in care, teaching and research. Training goals 
for future cardiac imaging experts must be defined; academic and industry
partnerships should enable the connection to be made between imaging data and
clinical data on the one hand and outcomes on the other hand, using big-data
analysis and artificial intelligence.

These are often 
associated with atherosclerosis. This inflammation process triggers important
variations in the coronary arteries (CA) and can lead to coronary artery disease 
(CAD). The presence of CA calcification (CAC) has recently been shown to be a
strong predictor of CAD. In this clinical setting, computed tomography
angiography (CTA) has begun to play a crucial role as a non-intrusive imaging
method to characterize and study CA plaques. Herein, we describe an automated
algorithm to classify plaque as either normal, calcified, or non-calcified using 
2646 CTA images acquired from 73 patients. The automated technique is based on
various features that are extracted from the Gabor transform of the acquired CTA 
images. Specifically, seven features are extracted from the Gabor coefficients : 
energy, and Kapur, Max, Rényi, Shannon, Vajda, and Yager entropies. The features 
were then ordered based on the F-value and input to numerous classification
methods to achieve the best classification accuracy with the least number of
features. Moreover, two well-known feature reduction techniques were employed,
and the features acquired were also ranked according to F-value and input to
several classifiers. The best classification results were obtained using all
computed features without the employment of feature reduction, using a
probabilistic neural network. An accuracy, positive predictive value,
sensitivity, and specificity of 89.09%, 91.70%, 91.83% and 83.70% was obtained,
respectively. Based on these results, it is evident that the technique can be
helpful in the automated classification of plaques present in CTA images, and may
become an important tool to reduce procedural costs and patient radiation dose.
This could also aid clinicians in plaque diagnostics.

during acute heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and changes in
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.
BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia is a potential complication of RAAS inhibitors. For
patients with HF, fear of hyperkalemia may lead to failure to deliver
guideline-recommended doses of RAAS inhibitors.
METHODS: Serum potassium concentrations were measured daily from baseline (<24 h 
after admission) until discharge or day 7 in 1,589 patients enrolled in the
PROTECT (Placebo-Controlled Randomized Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine
Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline for Patients Hospitalized with Acute
Decompensated Heart Failure and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on
Congestion and Renal Function) trial. Incident hyperkalemia was defined as at
least 1 episode of potassium >5.0 mEq/l. The primary outcome was all-cause
mortality at 180 days.
RESULTS: Overall, serum potassium concentrations increased from 4.3 ± 0.6 mEq/l
at baseline to 4.5 ± 0.6 mEq/l at discharge or day 7 (p < 0.001). Patients
developing incident hyperkalemia (n = 564; 35%) were more often taking
mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) therapy prior to hospitalization and were
more likely to have them down-titrated during hospitalization, independent of
confounders. Incident hyperkalemia was not associated with adverse outcomes. Yet,
down-titration of MRAs during hospitalization was independently associated with
180-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to
2.60), regardless of incident hyperkalemia (pinteraction >0.10). Patients with
incident hyperkalemia who were discharged with the same or increased dose of MRAs
(HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.77) 
had a lower 180-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Incident hyperkalemia is common in patients hospitalized for acute
HF and is not associated with adverse outcomes. Incident hyperkalemia is
associated with down-titration of MRAs, but patients who maintained or increased 
their dose of MRAs and/or ACE inhibitors/ARB during acute HF hospitalization had 
better 180-day survival.

heart failure (HF) hospitalization for outpatients with HF with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function 
Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial.
BACKGROUND: Although risk assessment models are available for patients with HF
with reduced ejection fraction, few have assessed the risks of death and
hospitalization in patients with HFpEF.
METHODS: The following 5 methods: logistic regression with a forward selection of
variables; logistic regression with a lasso regularization for variable
selection; random forest (RF); gradient descent boosting; and support vector
machine, were used to train models for assessing risks of mortality and HF
hospitalization through 3 years of follow-up and were validated using 5-fold
cross-validation. Model discrimination and calibration were estimated using
receiver-operating characteristic curves and Brier scores, respectively. The top 
prediction variables were assessed by using the best performing models, using the
incremental improvement of each variable in 5-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The RF was the best performing model with a mean C-statistic of 0.72
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.75) for predicting mortality (Brier
score: 0.17), and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.81) for HF hospitalization (Brier
score: 0.19). Blood urea nitrogen levels, body mass index, and Kansas City
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) subscale scores were strongly associated with
mortality, whereas hemoglobin level, blood urea nitrogen, time since previous HF 
hospitalization, and KCCQ scores were the most significant predictors of HF
hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: These models predict the risks of mortality and HF hospitalization
in patients with HFpEF and emphasize the importance of health status data in
determining prognosis. (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure

and the myocardium (MYO) from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images is an
important step for diagnosis and monitoring cardiac diseases. Spatial context
information may be highly beneficial for segmentation performance improvement. To
this end, this paper proposes an iterative multi-path fully convolutional network
(IMFCN) to effectively leverage spatial context for automatic cardiac
segmentation in cine MR images.
METHODS: To effectively leverage spatial context information, the proposed IMFCN 
explicitly models the interslice spatial correlations using a multi-path late
fusion strategy. First, the contextual inputs including both the adjacent slices 
and the already predicted mask of the above adjacent slice are processed by
independent feature-extraction paths. Then, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling
(ASPP) module is employed at the feature fusion process to combine the extracted 
high-level contextual features in a more effective way. Finally, deep supervision
(DS) and batch-wise class re-weighting mechanism are utilized to enhance the
training of the proposed network.
RESULTS: The proposed IMFCN was evaluated and analyzed on the MICCAI 2017
automatic cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC) dataset. On the held-out training
dataset reserved for testing, our method effectively improved its counterparts
that without spatial context and that with spatial context but using an early
fusion strategy. On the 50 subjects test dataset, our method achieved Dice
similarity coefficient of 0.935, 0.920, and 0.905, and Hausdorff distance of
7.66, 12.10, and 8.80 mm for LV, RV, and MYO, respectively, which are comparable 
or even better than the state-of-the-art methods of ACDC Challenge. In addition, 
to explore the applicability to other datasets, the proposed IMFCN was retrained 
on the Sunnybrook dataset for LV segmentation and also produced comparable
performance to the state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an automatic end-to-end fully convolutional
architecture for accurate cardiac segmentation. The proposed method provides an
effective way to leverage spatial context in a two-dimensional manner and results
in precise and consistent segmentation results.

understand the current blood pressure (BP) control status and treatment patterns 
in Chinese diabetes patients as well as to identify factors associated with BP
control. The demographic data, anthropometric parameters, and laboratory results 
were collected from 24 512 type 2 diabetes patients. The BP goal was a systolic
BP <130 mm Hg and a diastolic BP <80 mm Hg regardless of a history of
hypertension or current antihypertensive treatment. The overall prevalence of
hypertension was 59.9% with geographical differences. Among the diabetes patients
with hypertension, 76.9% received antihypertensive medicines. Calcium channel
blockers (39.3%), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (26.6%), and then
β-blockers (14.0%) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (13.6%) were
frequently used for BP control. Only 17.5% (n = 2658) of diabetes patients with
hypertension reached the recommended target BP. Body mass index <24 kg/m2 , urban
resident, frequent physical activity, good adherence to medication, comorbidity
with cardiovascular disease, achieving glycemic goal (HbA1c <7.0%), achieving
lipid goal (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <2.59 mmol/L) were independent
factors that predicted achievement of target BP goal. On the contrary,
comorbidity with chronic kidney disease predicted failure to achieve target BP
goal. Patients who were treated in a cardiology department or lived in the North 
were more likely to achieve BP goals. A considerable proportion of diabetic
patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended BP targets. More aggressive
efforts should be made to overcome the diverse barriers and facilitate the
optimization of diabetes management.

learning (ML) algorithms to estimate average treatment effects under the
assumption of exogeneity (selection on observables).
DATA SOURCES: Simulated data and observational data on hospitalized adults.
STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the performance of several ML-based estimators,
including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees, Causal Random Forests, Double Machine Learning, and Bayesian Causal
Forests, applying these methods to simulated data as well as data on the effects 
of right heart catheterization.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Monte Carlo studies, ML-based estimators generated
estimates with smaller bias than traditional regression approaches, demonstrating
substantial (69 percent-98 percent) bias reduction in some scenarios. Bayesian
Causal Forests and Double Machine Learning were top performers, although all were
sensitive to high dimensional (>150) sets of covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: ML-based methods are promising methods for estimating treatment
effects, allowing for the inclusion of many covariates and automating the search 
for nonlinearities and interactions among variables. We provide guidance and
sample code for researchers interested in implementing these tools in their own
empirical work.

clinical variables that have prognostic significance. In this study our goal was 
to develop improved metrics that utilize a variable number of input parameters.
We first used Bootstrap Lasso Regression (BLR) - a Machine Learning method for
selecting important variables - to identify a prognostic set of features that
identify patients at high risk of death 6-months after presenting with an Acute
Coronary Syndrome. Using data derived from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary 
Events (GRACE) we trained a logistic regression model using these features and
evaluated its performance on a development set (N = 43,063) containing patients
who have values for all features, and a separate dataset (N = 6,363) that
contains patients who have missing feature values. The final model, Ridge
Logistic Regression with Variable Inputs (RLRVI), uses imputation to estimate
values for missing features. BLR identified 19 features, 8 of which appear in the
GRACE score. RLRVI had modest, yet statistically significant, improvement over
the standard GRACE score on both datasets. Moreover, for patients who are
relatively low-risk (GRACE≤87), RLRVI had an AUC and Hazard Ratio of 0.754 and
6.27, respectively, vs. 0.688 and 2.46 for GRACE, (p < 0.007). RLRVI has improved
discriminatory performance on patients who have values for the 8 GRACE features

system (EWS) for predicting clinical deterioration of hospitalised general
internal medicine patients.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study of clinical predictions made at the end
of the daytime work-shift for an academic general internal medicine floor team
compared with the risk assessment from an automated EWS collected at the same
time.
SETTING: Internal medicine teaching wards at a single tertiary care academic
medical centre in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Intern physicians working on the internal medicine wards and an
automated EWS (Rothman Index by PeraHealth).
OUTCOME: Clinical deterioration within 24 hours including cardiac or pulmonary
arrest, rapid response team activation or unscheduled intensive care unit
transfer.
RESULTS: We collected predictions for 1874 patient days and saw 35 clinical
deteriorations (1.9%). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for
the EWS was 0.73 vs 0.70 for physicians (p=0.571). A linear regression model
combining physician and EWS predictions had an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming
physicians (p=0.016) and the EWS (p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the performance of the EWS and
physicians in predicting clinical deterioration at 24 hours on an inpatient
general medicine ward. A combined model outperformed either alone. The EWS and
physicians identify partially overlapping sets of at-risk patients suggesting
they rely on different cues or decision rules for their predictions.

mortality. Current treatment is mostly reactive. The Hypotension Prediction Index
(HPI) algorithm is able to predict hypotension minutes before the blood pressure 
actually decreases. Internal and external validation of this algorithm has shown 
good sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that the use of this algorithm
in combination with a personalized treatment protocol will reduce the time
weighted average (TWA) in hypotension during surgery spent in hypotension
intraoperatively.
METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to include 100 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac
surgery with an anticipated duration of more than 2 h, necessitating the use of
an arterial line, and an intraoperatively targeted mean arterial pressure (MAP)
of > 65 mmHg. This study is divided into two parts; in phase A baseline TWA data 
from 40 patients will be collected prospectively. A device (HemoSphere) with HPI 
software will be connected but fully covered. Phase B is designed as a
single-center, randomized controlled trial were 60 patients will be randomized
with computer-generated blocks of four, six or eight, with an allocation ratio of
1:1. In the intervention arm the HemoSphere with HPI will be used to guide
treatment; in the control arm the HemoSphere with HPI software will be connected 
but fully covered. The primary outcome is the TWA in hypotension during surgery.
DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to explore whether the use of a
machine-learning algorithm intraoperatively can result in less hypotension. To
test this, the treating anesthesiologist will need to change treatment behavior
from reactive to proactive.

Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03376347 . The trial was

imagery is of great importance in computer-aided diagnosis and in treatment of
cardiovascular diseases. However, this task has not been well addressed for two
reasons. First, because of the difficulty of acquisition, and the laborious
labeling from personnel, optical coherence tomography image datasets are usually 
small. Second, optical coherence tomography images contain a variety of imaging
artifacts, which hinder a clear observation of the vascular wall. In order to
overcome these limitations, a new method of cardiovascular vulnerable plaque
segmentation is proposed. This method constructs a novel Deep Residual U-Net to
segment vulnerable plaque regions. Furthermore, in order to overcome the
inaccuracy in object boundary segmentation which previous research has shown
extensively, a loss function consisting of weighted cross-entropy loss and Dice
coefficient is proposed to solve this problem. Thorough experiments and analysis 
have been carried out to verify the effectiveness and superior performance of the

burden of cardiovascular disease and its associated mortality. The significance
of voltage dependent L-type Ca²⁺ channels to Ca²⁺ influx, and of their regulatory
mechanisms in the development of heart disease, is well established. A wide
variety of L-type Ca²⁺ channel inhibitors and Ca²⁺ antagonists have been found to
be beneficial not only in the treatment of hypertension, but also in myocardial
infarction and heart failure. Over the past two decades, another class of Ca²⁺
channel - the voltage independent store-operated Ca²⁺ channel - has been
implicated in the regulation and fine tuning of Ca²⁺ entry in both cardiac and
smooth muscle cells. Store-operated Ca²⁺ channels are activated by the depletion 
of Ca²⁺ stores within the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, or by low levels of
cytosolic Ca²⁺, thereby facilitating agonist-induced Ca²⁺ influx. Store-operated 
Ca²⁺ entry through this pivotal pathway involves both stromal interaction
molecule (STIM) and Orai channels. Different degrees of changes in these proteins
are considered to promote Ca²⁺ entry and hence contribute to the pathogenesis of 
cardiovascular dysfunction. Several blockers of store-operated Ca²⁺ channels
acting at the level of both STIM and Orai channels have been shown to depress
Ca²⁺ influx and lower blood pressure. However, their specificity, safety, and
clinical significance remain to be established. Thus, there is an ongoing
challenge in the development of selective inhibitors of store-operated Ca²⁺
channels that act in vascular smooth muscles for the improved treatment of
hypertension.

medical therapy in the outpatient setting for treatment of chronic heart failure.
However, the benefits of continuation (or discontinuation) of major chronic heart
failure therapies when treating acute heart failure during hospitalization are
less clear. Real and anticipated worsening renal function, hyperkalemia and
hypotension are the three major reasons for discontinuation of
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors during hospitalization, and a
failure to resume renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors before
discharge could worsen cardiovascular outcomes. Available data, mostly
observational, shows that continuation or initiation of
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors appears efficacious, safe, and
well tolerated in majority of acute heart failure patients during
hospitalization. Worsening renal function portends poor prognosis only if
associated with congestion in acute heart failure, and clinicians should not
de-escalate diuretic therapy routinely for worsening renal function.

vein isolation (CPVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF), but the role of
radiofrequency power in AI-guided CPVI remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: We investigated 60 patients with AF undergoing AI-guided CPVI (mean age,
66 ± 9 years; nonparoxysmal AF in 16). The first 40 patients were randomly
assigned to low-power (LP; n = 20) and medium-power (MP; n = 20) groups and the
following 20 patients to high-power (HP). In LP, radiofrequency (RF) application 
was done at 30 W at the anterior and 20 W at the posterior left atrial (LA) wall,
while in MP, it was at 40 W at the anterior and 30 W at the posterior LA wall. In
HP, 50 W was applied at the anterior, 40 W at posterior LA wall and 30 W on the
esophagus. At each ablation point, target AI was 400 at the anterior, 360 at the 
posterior LA wall, and 260 on the esophagus.
RESULTS: The time to complete both-side CPVI was shortest in HP (median,
40 minutes, interquartile range [IQR], 28-63) followed by MP (58 [49-83] minutes,
P = .008 vs HP) and LP (84 [72-93] minutes, P = .002 vs MP). Higher RF power
application significantly increased first-pass isolation rate (55% in LP, 80% in 
MP and 85% in HP, P = .002) and decreased LA-PV reconnection rate (10% in LP, 8% 
in MP, and 0% in HP, P = .03).
CONCLUSION: In AI-guided PVI, the HP RF application can shorten the time to
complete PVI with a high rate of first-pass isolation and a low rate of LA-PV
reconnection.

end-stage kidney disease but also atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and
heart failure. Aldosterone is a key risk factor promoting inflammation and
fibrosis causing cardio-renal failure. Current options and challenges with
mitigating the risk of aldosterone are reviewed.
RECENT FINDINGS: More aggressive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
blockade can be maintained in individuals with hyperkalemia if new potassium
binders are added. Aldosterone synthase inhibitors may lower aldosterone without 
causing hyperkalemia. Novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
(MRA) are able to lower proteinuria and markers of heart failure, with limited
potassium problems and without renal impairment. Ongoing clinical trials are
evaluating the safety and potential benefits of nonsteroidal MRAs on progression 
of renal disease and development of cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes
and kidney disease.
SUMMARY: Aldosterone is an important driver of inflammation and fibrosis leading 
to renal and cardiovascular complications. MRA lower albuminuria but data showing
prevention of end-stage kidney disease are lacking. Side effects including
hyperkalemia have previously prevented long-term studies in diabetic kidney
disease but new treatment strategies with potassium binders, aldosterone synthase
inhibitors and nonsteroidal MRA have been developed for clinical testing.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31599747.pdf

States. They have a lifelong risk of developing heart failure. Current concepts
do not sufficiently address mechanisms of heart failure development specifically 
for these patients. Here, analysis of heart tissue from an infant with tetralogy 
of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (ToF/PS) labeled with isotope-tagged thymidine 
demonstrated that cardiomyocyte cytokinesis failure is increased in this common
form of CHD. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to discover that the
underlying mechanism of cytokinesis failure is repression of the cytokinesis gene
ECT2, downstream of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). Inactivation of the β-AR
genes and administration of the β-blocker propranolol increased cardiomyocyte
division in neonatal mice, which increased the number of cardiomyocytes
(endowment) and conferred benefit after myocardial infarction in adults.
Propranolol enabled the division of ToF/PS cardiomyocytes in vitro. These results
suggest that β-blockers could be evaluated for increasing cardiomyocyte division 
in patients with ToF/PS and other types of CHD.

insulin and also varying responses to meals and exercise. We introduce a new
adaptive run-to-run model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that can be used to 
help people with T1D better manage their glucose levels using an artificial
pancreas (AP). The algorithm adapts to individuals' different insulin
sensitivities, glycemic response to meals, and adjustment during exercise as a
continuous input during free-living conditions.
METHODS: A new insulin sensitivity adaptation (ISA) algorithm is presented that
updates each patient's insulin sensitivity during nonmeal periods to reduce the
error between the actual glucose levels and the process model. We further
demonstrate how an adaptive learning postprandial hypoglycemia prevention
algorithm (ALPHA) presented in the previous work can complement the ISA
algorithm, and the algorithm can adapt in several days. We further show that if
physical activity is incorporated as a continuous input (heart rate and
accelerometry), performance is improved. The contribution of this work is the
description of the ISA algorithm and the evaluation of how ISA, ALPHA, and
incorporation of exercise metrics as a continuous input can impact glycemic
control.
RESULTS: Incorporating ALPHA, ISA, and physical activity into the MPC improved
glycemic outcome measures. The adaptive learning postprandial hypoglycemia
prevention algorithm combined with ISA significantly reduced time spent in
hypoglycemia by 71.7% and the total number of rescue carbs by 67.8% to 0.37%
events/day/patient. Insulin sensitivity adaptation significantly reduced
model-actual mismatch by 12.2% compared to an AP without ISA. Incorporating
physical activity as a continuous input modestly improved time in the range 70 to
180 mg/dL during high physical activity days from 84.4% to 84.9% and reduced the 
percentage time in hypoglycemia by 23.8% from 2.1% to 1.6%.

interrelated phenomena playing pivotal roles in the development of pathological
cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Exercise training is effective to convert 
pathological into physiological hypertrophy in the spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHR), and IGF-1-key humoral mediator of exercise training-inhibits
myocardial NHE-1, at least in normotensive rats. Therefore, we hypothesize that
IGF-1 by hampering NHE-1 hyperactivity and oxidative stress should exert a
cardioprotective effect in the SHR.
METHODS: NHE-1 activity [proton efflux ( J H + ) mmol L-1 min-1], expression and 
phosphorylation; H2O2 production; superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity;
contractility and calcium transients were measured in SHR hearts in the
presence/absence of IGF-1.
RESULTS: IGF-1 significantly decreased NHE-1 activity ( J H + at pHi 6.95:
1.39 ± 0.32, n = 9 vs C 3.27 ± 0.3, n = 20, P < .05); effect prevented by AG1024,
an antagonist of IGF-1 receptor (2.7 ± 0.4, n = 7); by the PI3K inhibitor
wortmannin (3.14 ± 0.41, n = 7); and the AKT inhibitor MK2206 (3.37 ± 0.43,
n = 14). Moreover, IGF-1 exerted an antioxidant effect revealed by a significant 
reduction in H2O2 production accompanied by an increase in SOD activity. In
addition, IGF-1 improved cardiomyocyte contractility as evidenced by an increase 
in sarcomere shortening and a decrease in the relaxation constant, underlined by 
an increase in the amplitude and rate of decay of the calcium transients.
CONCLUSION: IGF-1 exerts a cardioprotective role on the hypertrophied hearts of
the SHR, in which the inhibition of NHE-1 hyperactivity, as well as the positive 
inotropic and antioxidant effects, emerges as key players.

proposed to prioritize potential disease-associated miRNAs. Independent
benchmarking of these methods is warranted to assess their effectiveness and
robustness.
RESULTS: Based on more than 8000 novel miRNA-disease associations from the latest
HMDD v3.1 database, we perform systematic comparison among 36 readily available
prediction methods. Their overall performances are evaluated with rigorous
precision-recall curve analysis, where 13 methods show acceptable accuracy (AUPRC
> 0.200) while the top two methods achieve a promising AUPRC over 0.300, and most
of these methods are also highly ranked when considering only the causal
miRNA-disease associations as the positive samples. The potential of performance 
improvement is demonstrated by combining different predictors or adopting a more 
updated miRNA similarity matrix, which would result in up to 16% and 46% of AUPRC
augmentations compared to the best single predictor and the predictors using the 
previous similarity matrix, respectively. Our analysis suggests a common issue of
the available methods, which is that the prediction results are severely biased
toward well-annotated diseases with many associated miRNAs known and cannot
further stratify the positive samples by discriminating the causal miRNA-disease 
associations from the general miRNA-disease associations.
CONCLUSION: Our benchmarking results not only provide a reference for biomedical 
researchers to choose appropriate miRNA-disease association predictors for their 
purpose, but also suggest the future directions for the development of more

In this study, we preliminarily studied the function and mechanism of bilobalide 
(BIL) on interleukin (IL)-17-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells. CCK-8
and migration assays were used to detect the functions of IL-7, BIL, and microRNA
(miR)-125a on cell viability and migration. The miR-125a level was changed by
transfection, and tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Additionally, Western blot tested the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and
tumor necrosis factor-α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and pathway-related
proteins. Moreover, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also was used to detect
inflammatory factor levels. IL-7 was used to construct an inflammatory injury
model in ATDC5 cells. Based on this, BIL inhibited IL-17-induced cell viability, 
migration, and expressions of inflammatory factors and MMPs. Furthermore, we
found BIL negatively regulated miR-125a, and the miR-125a mimic could partly
reverse the effects of BIL on IL-17-injury. Finally, we showed that BIL inhibited
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways,
and the miR-125a mimic had the opposite effect. BIL inhibited IL-17-induced
inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells by downregulation of miR-125a via JNK and

off-target effects including cardiovascular toxicity and renal injury, most
likely via endothelin (ET)-1 upregulation. ET-1 via stimulation of the ETA
receptor has pro-hypertensive actions whereas stimulation of the ETB receptor can
elicit both pro- or anti-hypertensive effects. In this study, our aim was to
determine the efficacy of selective ETA versus dual ETA/B receptor blockade for
the prevention of angiogenesis inhibitor-induced hypertension and albuminuria.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Male WKY rats were treated with vehicle, sunitinib
(angiogenesis inhibitor; 14 mg/kg/day) alone or in combination with macitentan
(ETA/B receptor antagonist; 30 mg/kg/day) or sitaxentan (selective ETA receptor
antagonist; 30 or 100 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. Compared to vehicle, sunitinib
treatment caused a rapid and sustained increase in mean arterial pressure of
∼25 mmHg. Co-treatment with macitentan or sitaxentan abolished the pressor
response to sunitinib. Sunitinib did not induce endothelial dysfunction. However,
it was associated with increased aortic, mesenteric and renal oxidative stress,
an effect that was absent in mesenteric arteries of the macitentan and sitaxentan
co-treated groups. Albuminuria was greater in the sunitinib- than vehicle-treated
group. Co-treatment with sitaxentan, but not macitentan, prevented this increase 
in albuminuria. Sunitinib treatment increased circulating and urinary
prostacyclin levels and had no effect on thromboxane levels. These increases in
prostacyclin were blunted by co-treatment with sitaxentan.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that both selective ETA and dual ETA/B
receptor antagonism prevents sunitinib-induced hypertension, while
sunitinib-induced albuminuria was only prevented by selective ETA receptor
antagonism. Additionally, our results uncover a role for prostacyclin in the
development of these effects. In conclusion, selective ETA receptor antagonism is
sufficient for the prevention of sunitinib-induced hypertension and renal injury.
TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: The endothelin (ET) system is implicated in the
pathogenesis of angiogenesis inhibitor-induced hypertension and renal injury.
Here we demonstrate that the development of angiogenesis inhibitor-induced
hypertension and albuminuria is solely dependent on the ETA receptor and that an 
upregulation in PGI2 plays a previously unidentified role in the deleterious
effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. Targeting the ETA receptor or downstream
pathways such as the increase in PGI2 may be the optimal treatment for
cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with angiogenesis inhibitors.

Top 10 Lessons We Learned in Congenital Heart Defects and Cardiology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital
health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not
only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the
mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning
(ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user
data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI
applications in different medical specialties and across developed and
resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs)
that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches
to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond
CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of
digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary
technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep
learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these
advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting
us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics
and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current 
attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction 
and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and
digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD
in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems
approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and
developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as
digital health continues to evolve worldwide.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31592719.pdf

Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in
computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy
and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The
increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that
someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of
whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some
specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing
them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand
this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper
researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in
specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It
concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to
replace the traditional physician-patient relationship.

treatment of heart failure, but data regarding the effect of this therapy on
numerous disorders associated with heart failure are limited.
Aim: To assess the impact of CRT on sleep breathing disorders, and to determine
the relationship between the changes in the autonomous nervous system and sleep
disorders after CRT.
Material and methods: The study included 55 patients with chronic heart failure
stable for at least last 3 months, in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III
or IV despite optimal medical therapy, with a reduced left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, QRS complex duration ≥ 120 ms, and sinus rhythm. Before
and 3 months after implementation of CRT echocardiography, 6-minute walk test
(6MWT), polysomnography with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
questionnaire and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed. Also
baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was evaluated.
Results: After implementation of CRT, the values of the apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI), apnea index (AI), and central and mixed apnea indexes (CAI, MAI) were
statistically significantly reduced. The strongest negative correlations were
demonstrated for changes in CAI and changes in BRS. An improvement in sleep
quality, daytime sleepiness, LVEF, NYHA class, and 6MWT was observed and was the 
most strongly associated with the improvement in CAI, too.
Conclusions: CRT has a beneficial effect on subjective and objective features of 
sleep, as well as on the function of the autonomous nervous system. In addition, 
patients with heart failure and coexisting central sleep apnea may benefit most
from this therapy.

    Physiol Rep. 2019 Dec;7(23):e14311.

This investigation explored the hypothesis that whether the coefficient of
variation of the fourth harmonic amplitude of the radial pulse wave (C4CV)
predicts the risk of macrovascular and microvascular events in patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Radial pulse wave and brachial blood pressure were
measured at baseline in 2324 patients with T2DM and C4CV was calculated using the
Fourier series method. Macrovascular and microvascular events during follow-up
were determined by medical records. We plotted the Kaplan-Meier curve and
performed a Cox proportional hazard model and a log-rank test to estimate the
effectiveness of C4CV as a risk predictor. We divided patients into quartile
groups based on C4CV (<4.3%, 4.3% to 6.8%, 6.8% to 11.4%, and >11.4%). Compared
with patients with C4CV < 4.3%, patients with C4CV> 11.4% had a double incidence 
of macrovascular events (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.70-2.67) and microvascular
events (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.67-2.58), and the incidence of
cardiovascular death was three times (hazard ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.10-8.83). The
Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of both macrovascular and
microvascular outcomes increases with the increase in quartile level of C4CV
value (P < 0.0001). These associations remained after adjustment for age, gender,
smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, dyslipidemia,
diabetes duration, Hba1c, and cardiovascular disease (P < 0.0001). C4CV is a
novel independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, macrovascular events,
and microvascular events in patients with T2DM.

concussion. We explored this technique in a cohort of code stroke patients to see
whether a signature could be identified to aid in the diagnosis of large vessel
occlusion (LVO) stroke.
METHODS: A military-grade three-axis accelerometer was affixed to a headset.
Accelerometer and electrocardiogram (ECG) outputs were digitized at 1.6 kHz. We
call the resulting digitized signals the ""headpulse."" Three-minute recordings
were performed immediately after computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA)
and/or immediately before and after attempted mechanical thrombectomy in patents 
with suspected stroke. The resulting waveforms were inspected by eye and then
subjected to supervised machine learning (MATLAB Classification Learner R2018a)
to train a model using fivefold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Of 42 code stroke subjects with recordings, 19 (45%) had LVO and 23
(55%) had normal CTAs. In patients without LVO, ECG-triggered waveforms followed 
a self-similar time course revealing that the headpulse is highly coupled to the 
cardiac contraction. However, in most patients with LVO, headpulses showed little
cardiac contraction correlation. We term this abnormality ""chaos"" and
parameterized it with 156 measures of trace-by-trace variation from the
ECG-signal-averaged mean for machine learning model training. Selecting the best 
model, using biometric data only, we properly classified 15/19 LVOs and 20/23
non-LVO patients, with receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.79,
sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 87%, P < 0.0001. Headpulse waveforms
following thrombectomy showed return of cardiac contraction correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: Headpulse recordings performed on patients with suspected acute
stroke significantly identify those with LVO. The lack of temporal correlation of
the headpulse with cardiac contraction and resolution to normal may reflect
changes in cerebral blood flow and may provide a useful technique to triage
stroke patients for thrombectomy using a noninvasive device.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31591693.pdf

classification subdivides mesothelioma tumors into three histological types:
epithelioid, biphasic and sarcomatoid MM. MM is a highly complex and
heterogeneous disease, rendering its diagnosis and histological typing difficult

modalities2. Here we have developed a new approach-based on deep convolutional
neural networks-called MesoNet to accurately predict the overall survival of
mesothelioma patients from whole-slide digitized images, without any
pathologist-provided locally annotated regions. We validated MesoNet on both an
internal validation cohort from the French MESOBANK and an independent cohort
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also demonstrated that the model was more
accurate in predicting patient survival than using current pathology practices.
Furthermore, unlike classical black-box deep learning methods, MesoNet identified
regions contributing to patient outcome prediction. Strikingly, we found that
these regions are mainly located in the stroma and are histological features
associated with inflammation, cellular diversity and vacuolization. These
findings suggest that deep learning models can identify new features predictive
of patient survival and potentially lead to new biomarker discoveries.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31591589.pdf

that removes damaged tissues to facilitate tissue repair/regeneration. However,
overactive and prolonged inflammation compromises healing, which may be
counteracted by antiinflammatory mechanisms. A key regulatory factor in an
inflammatory response is the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which can be
produced by a number of immune cells, including subsets of B lymphocytes. Here,
we investigated IL-10-producing B cells in pericardial adipose tissues (PATs) and
their role in the healing process following acute MI in mice. We found that
IL-10-producing B cells were enriched in PATs compared to other adipose depots
throughout the body, with the majority of them bearing a surface phenotype
consistent with CD5+ B-1a cells (CD5+ B cells). These cells were detected early
in life, maintained a steady presence during adulthood, and resided in
fat-associated lymphoid clusters. The cytokine IL-33 and the chemokine CXCL13
were preferentially expressed in PATs and contributed to the enrichment of
IL-10-producing CD5+ B cells. Following acute MI, the pool of CD5+ B cells was
expanded in PATs. These cells accumulated in the infarcted heart during the
resolution of MI-induced inflammation. B cell-specific deletion of IL-10 worsened
cardiac function, exacerbated myocardial injury, and delayed resolution of
inflammation following acute MI. These results revealed enrichment of
IL-10-producing B cells in PATs and a significant contribution of these cells to 
the antiinflammatory processes that terminate MI-induced inflammation. Together, 
these findings have identified IL-10-producing B cells as therapeutic targets to

McGregor et al. to be a major barrier to the translation of heterotopic cardiac
xenotransplantaton into the orthotopic position. It is characterized by graft
dysfunction in the absence of rejection within 24-48 hours of transplantation. We
describe our experience with PCXD at a single program.
METHODS: Orthotopic transplantation of genetically engineered pig hearts was
performed in 6 healthy baboons. The immunosuppression regimen included induction 
by anti-CD20 mAb, Thymoglobulin, cobra venom factor and anti-CD40 mAb and
maintenance with anti-CD40 mAb, MMF and tapering doses of steroids. Telemetry was
used to asses graft function. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used to
support one recipient. A full human clinical transplant team was involved in
these experiments and the procedure was performed by skilled transplant surgeons.
RESULTS: A maximal survival of 40 hours was achieved in these experiments. The
surgical procedures were uneventful and all hearts were weaned from
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) without issue. Support with inotropes and
vasopressors was generally required after separation from CPB. The cardiac
xenografts performed well immediately, but within the first several hours
required increasing support and ultimately suffered arrest despite maximal
interventions. All hearts were explanted immediately; histology showed no signs
of rejection.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite excellent surgical technique, uneventful weaning from CPB,
and adequate initial function, orthotopic cardiac xenografts slowly fail within
24-48 hours without evidence of rejection. Modification of preservation
techniques and minimizing donor organ ischemic time may be able to ameliorate
PCXD.

radionuclide imaging among patients with cardiomyopathy reported limitations
associated with the prognostic power of global parameters derived from planar
imaging [1]. Employing multivariate analysis, we further showed the regional
washout associated with territories adjacent to infarcted myocardium obtained
from single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (SPECT) yielded superior 
prognostic power over the other planar and SPECT indices in predicting future
cardiac events [1]. The aim of this study was to apply an artificial neural
network (Neural Analyser version 2.9.5) to the original data from the same
patient cohort to evaluate the most potent prognostic index for future cardiac
events among patient with cardiomyopathy.
METHODS: The original data were reevaluated using an artificial neural network
(Neural Analyser version 2.9.5). There were 84 input variables in the original 22
patients from clinical data, electrocardiogram (rest, stress, and continuous
ambulatory electrocardiogram recording), transthoracic echocardiography, coronary
angiogram, sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT, planar and SPECT 123I-mIBG, and 
genetic and biomarkers, detailed in the previous work. A single binary output was
a cardiac event or no cardiac event in the follow-up period.
RESULTS: Following training and validation phases, the optimal number of inputs
was determined to be two with a training loss of 0.025 and selection loss <0.001.
The final architecture had inputs of a change in left ventricular ejection
fraction (Δ > -10%) and 123I-mIBG planar global washout (>30%), two hidden layers
of 6 and 1 node, respectively, and a binary output. Using receiver operator
characteristics analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.75 correlating
to a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 50%.
CONCLUSION: The premise that regional washout of 123I-mIBG SPECT from
noninfarcted tissue is the best predictor of cardiac events was built on has a
sound and logical foundation. By artificial neural network analysis; however,
123I-mIBG planar global washout of >30% was shown to be the best indicator for
risk of cardiac event when accompanied by a decline in left ventricular ejection 
fraction of >10%. Further investigation should be undertaken assessing
assimilation into big data and the potential for automated feature extraction
from raw image datasets with convolutional neural networks.

DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up cohort study.
SETTING: AD patients from two teaching hospitals in Taiwan with 3-year
follow-ups.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 330 AD patients with a mean age of 80.7 years, a mean
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 18.7, and a mean Clinical Dementia
Rating Sum of Boxes (CDRSB) score of 6.9.
MEASUREMENTS: All patients completed a clinically functional assessment and a
neuropsychological test battery at baseline and yearly follow-ups. The VRF burden
was combined into a summative VRF index at baseline (ie, having one, two, or more
VRFs); VRFs included coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension,
cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, and physical
inactivity. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) method was used to analyze 
the correlations between the VRFs and longitudinal MMSE and CDRSB changes.
RESULTS: The results of the GEE adjusted for age, years of education, sex,
disease duration, baseline MMSE score, time, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier
status, use of medications (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists), and hospitalization rates and showed 
that patients with more than three VRFs had more rapid cognitive decline than
patients without VRFs (MMSE, P = .02; CDRSB, P = .001) as well as patients with
three or fewer VRFs (MMSE, P = .009; CDRSB, P = .02). Subsequent analyses of APOE
ε4 carriers with more than three VRFs also showed their more rapid cognitive
decline compared with patients without VRFs (MMSE, P = .02; CDRSB, P = .001) and 
patients with three or fewer VRFs (MMSE, P = .009; CDRSB, P = .02), but no

pathophysiology of heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Hyperkalemia risk
limits the therapeutic use of conventional MR antagonists. AZD9977 is a
nonsteroidal, selective MR modulator that may protect nonepithelial tissues
without disturbing electrolyte balance. This phase I study investigated the
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple oral
doses of AZD9977 in healthy volunteers. Twenty-seven male participants aged
23-45 years were randomized 3:1 to receive oral AZD9977 or placebo for 8 days
(with twice-daily dosing on days 2-7), in dose cohorts of 50, 150, and 300 mg
(AZD9977, n = 6 per cohort; placebo, n = 3 per cohort). Adverse events occurred
in 4 of 18 participants receiving AZD9977 (22.2%) and 6 of 9 receiving placebo
(66.7%), all of mild or moderate severity; none were serious or led to
withdrawal. AZD9977 was rapidly absorbed, with median time of maximum
concentration of 0.50-0.84 hours across dose groups. Area under the curve and
maximum concentration were approximately dose proportional but elimination and
accumulation terminal half-life increased with dose. Steady-state was reached
after 3-4 days, with dose-dependent accumulation of 1.2-1.7-fold. Renal clearance
was 5.9-6.5 L/hour and 24-37% of AZD9977 was excreted in the urine. Serum
aldosterone levels increased dose dependently from days -1 to 7 in participants
receiving AZD9977, but serum potassium levels and urinary electrolyte excretion
were unchanged. AZD9977 was generally well-tolerated with no safety concerns.
Exploratory outcomes suggested reduced hyperkalemia risk compared with MR
antagonists. These findings support further clinical development of AZD9977.

diseases (CVDs) among cancer patients following the use of the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling inhibitors. However, data for patients
with a history of cancer before active cancer treatment are lacking. This study
aims to investigate the distribution of CVD-related comorbidities before cancer
treatment in potential VEGF antagonists candidates.
METHODS: A total of 22 500 newly diagnosed cancer patients registered from 1
January 2011 to 31 December 2017 were included. Cancer patients with colorectal
cancer (CRC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), thyroid cancer, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), and lung cancer were selected.
RESULTS: Hypertension (HTN), coronary heart diseases, atrial fibrillation, and
heart failure were top CVD comorbidities among studied cancers. HTN was the most 
prevalent CVD (26.0%). The prevalence of HTN in RCC, CRC (33.5 and 29.4%
respectively) was significantly higher than that in HCC, lung cancer, and thyroid
cancer patients (25.1, 24.5, and 23.1%, respectively). Among cancer patients with
HTN, the majority of cancer patients fall in grade III (75.7%) and very high
cardiovascular risk level (85.4%). Out of the 5847 HTN patients, 26% were not in 
antihypertensive use, and 34.2% failed to achieve the target blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: Cancer patients carry a high burden of CVD-related comorbidities
before the application of VEGF antagonists. HTN is the most prevalent comorbid
condition, and cancer patients with HTN constitute substantial cardiovascular
risks and a higher co-prevalence of other CVDs.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31584518.pdf

reduce the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2
diabetes. In populations that largely did not have heart failure at the time of
enrolment, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decreased the risk of
serious new-onset heart failure events by ≈30%. In addition, in the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin reduced the risk of both pump failure and sudden
deaths, the two most common modes of death among patients with heart failure. In 
none of the three trials could the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure 
be explained by the actions of these drugs as diuretics or anti-hyperglycaemic
agents. These observations raise the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could
reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with established heart failure,
including those without diabetes. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is enrolling ≈3600
patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
(≤ 40%), half of whom are expected not to have diabetes. Patients are being
randomized to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, which is added to all
appropriate treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and
neprilysin, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The primary
endpoint is the time-to-first event analysis of the combined risk of
cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial will
also evaluate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function, cardiovascular
death, all-cause mortality, and recurrent hospitalization events. By adjusting
eligibility based on natriuretic peptide levels to the baseline ejection
fraction, the trial will preferentially enrol high-risk patients. A large
proportion of the participants is expected to have an ejection fraction < 30%,
and the estimated annual event rate is expected to be at least 15%. The
EMPEROR-Reduced trial is well-positioned to determine if the addition of
empagliflozin can add meaningfully to current approaches that have established
benefits in the treatment of chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.

contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality related to atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in women. Early detection of risk and targeted
management of atherosclerotic disease is fundamental to reduce ASCVD risk and
improve outcomes in women. In this review, we examine the utility of cardiac
computed tomography (CT) and coronary CT angiography (CTA) in three ASCVD
scenarios including coronary artery calcium scoring for risk stratification in
asymptomatic women, and coronary CTA for diagnosis and prognosis of stable
ischemic heart disease and acute chest pain. The risks of radiation exposure and 
the potential applications of novel technologies in women are explored.
RECENT FINDINGS: CTA provides the capabilities of early recognition and
management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent advancements
in plaque composition and morphology further enhance the prognostic yield from
coronary CTA. Innovations in stress perfusion and computational fluid dynamics
allow for evaluation of physiological measures of ischemia. In addition,
developments in artificial intelligence (AI) may also help unlock a deeper
understanding of atherosclerosis and risk in women. Coronary CTA is an accurate
and useful modality for early detection and management of ASCVD in women. Novel
technologies hold great promise for furthering our understanding of sex-specific

described, a huge number of reports have emerged. MAU is a specific integrated
marker of CV risk and targets organ damage in patients with hypertension, chronic
kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes and its recognition is important for
identifying patients at a high or very high global CV risk. The gold standard for
diagnosis is albumin measured in 24-hour urine collection (normal values of less 
than 30 mg/day, MAU of 30 to 300 mg/day, macroalbuminuria of more than 300
mg/day) or, more practically, the determination of urinary albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio in a urine morning sample (30 to 300 mg/g). MAU screening is mandatory in
individuals at risk of developing or presenting elevated global CV risk. Evidence
has shown that intensive treatment could turn MAU into normoalbuminuria.
Intensive treatment with the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, in combination with other
anti-hypertensive drugs and drugs covering other aspects of CV risk, such as
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, new anti-diabetic drugs, and statins, can
diminish the risk accompanying albuminuria in hypertensive patients with or
without CKD and diabetes.

Hypotension is common 
in patients having surgery and in critically ill patients. The severity and
duration of hypotension are associated with hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction. 
Hypotension is mostly treated reactively after low blood pressure values have
already occurred. However, prediction of hypotension before it becomes clinically
apparent would allow the clinician to treat hypotension pre-emptively, thereby
reducing the severity and duration of hypotension. Hypotension can now be
predicted minutes before it actually occurs from the blood pressure waveform
using machine-learning algorithms that can be trained to detect subtle changes in
cardiovascular dynamics preceding clinically apparent hypotension. However,
analyzing the complex cardiovascular system is a challenge because cardiovascular
physiology is highly interdependent, works within complicated networks, and is
influenced by compensatory mechanisms. Improved hemodynamic data collection and
integration will be a key to improve current models and develop new hypotension
prediction models.

those influenced by metabolism and immunity. Unfortunately, while the outline is 
recognisable, many details are still lacking to turn the understanding of a

resynchronization therapy (CRT); however, optimal patient selection remains
challenging due to substantial treatment heterogeneity among patients who meet
the clinical practice guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To apply machine learning to create an algorithm that predicts CRT
outcome using electronic health record (EHR) data avaible before the procedure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied machine learning and natural language processing 
to the EHR of 990 patients who received CRT at two academic hospitals between
2004-2015. The primary outcome was reduced CRT benefit, defined as <0%
improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 6-18 months
post-procedure or death by 18 months. Data regarding demographics, laboratory
values, medications, clinical characteristics, and past health services
utilization were extracted from the EHR available before the CRT procedure.
Bigrams (i.e., two-word sequences) were also extracted from the clinical notes
using natural language processing. Patients accrued on average 75 clinical notes 
(SD, 29) before the procedure including data not captured anywhere else in the
EHR. A machine learning model was built using 80% of the patient sample (training
and validation dataset), and tested on a held-out 20% patient sample (test
dataset). Among 990 patients receiving CRT the mean age was 71.6 (SD, 11.8),
78.1% were male, 87.2% non-Hispanic white, and the mean baseline LVEF was 24.8%
(SD, 7.69). Out of 990 patients, 403 (40.7%) were identified as having a reduced 
benefit from the CRT device (<0% LVEF improvement in 25.2%, death by 18 months in

recommended as a safe, well tolerated and effective oral anticoagulant for
reducing the risk of ischemic events among AF patients. It is of value in
prevention and treatment of VTE and pulmonary embolism. Comparing to VKA,
apixaban was superior in preventing stroke or systemic embolism with lower major 
bleeding events among AF patients. When combined with dual antiplatelet therapy
apixaban may cause dose-related increase in bleeding which reduces the benefit of

but the algorithms used by these devices to score sleep are not open source, and 
the raw sensor data is rarely accessible for external use. As a result, these
devices are limited in their usefulness for clinical and research applications,
despite holding much promise. We used a mobile application of our own creation to
collect raw acceleration data and heart rate from the Apple Watch worn by
participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the ambulatory period 
preceding in lab testing. Using this data, we compared the contributions of
multiple features (motion, local standard deviation in heart rate, and ""clock
proxy"") to performance across several classifiers. Best performance was achieved 
using neural nets, though the differences across classifiers were generally
small. For sleep-wake classification, our method scored 90% of epochs correctly, 
with 59.6% of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93% of true sleep epochs
(sensitivity) scored correctly. Accuracy for differentiating wake, NREM sleep,
and REM sleep was approximately 72% when all features were used. We generalized
our results by testing the models trained on Apple Watch data using data from the
Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and found that we were able to
predict sleep with performance comparable to testing on our own dataset. This
study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration

serious neurological and cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. The diagnosis
of SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method
requires many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test.
Several researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA
diagnosis. Among these options, the ECG signal is one of the most physiologically
relevant signals of SA occurrence, and one that can be easily recorded using a
wearable device. However, existing ECG signal-based methods mainly use features
(i.e. frequency domain, time domain, and other nonlinear features) acquired from 
ECG and its derived signals in order to construct the model. This requires
researchers to have rich experience in ECG, which is not common. A convolutional 
neural network (CNN) is a kind of deep neural network that can automatically
learn effective feature representation from training data and has been
successfully applied in many fields. Meanwhile, most studies have not considered 
the impact of adjacent segments on SA detection. Therefore, in this study, we
propose a modified LeNet-5 convolutional neural network with adjacent segments
for SA detection. Our experimental results show that our proposed method is
useful for SA detection, and achieves better or comparable results when compared 
with traditional machine learning methods.

30-day readmission among other clinically defined patient populations in the
United States. Investigation into the predictability of 30-day readmissions can
lead to clinical decision support tools and targeted interventions that can help 
care providers to improve individual patient care and reduce readmission risk.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a dynamic readmission risk prediction
model that yields daily predictions for patients hospitalized with heart failure 
toward identifying risk trajectories over time and identifying clinical
predictors associated with different patterns in readmission risk trajectories.
METHODS: A two-stage predictive modeling approach combining logistic and beta
regression was applied to electronic health record data accumulated daily to
predict 30-day readmission for 534 hospital encounters of patients with heart
failure over 2750 patient days. Unsupervised clustering was performed on
predictions to uncover time-dependent trends in readmission risk over the
patient's hospital stay. We used data collected between September 1, 2013, and
August 31, 2015, from a community hospital in Maryland (United States) for
patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Patients who died during the 
hospital stay or were transferred to other acute care hospitals or hospice care
were excluded.
RESULTS: Readmission occurred in 107 (107/534, 20.0%) encounters. The
out-of-sample area under curve for the 2-stage predictive model was 0.73 (SD
0.08). Dynamic clinical predictors capturing laboratory results and vital signs
had the highest predictive value compared with demographic, administrative,
medical, and procedural data included. Unsupervised clustering identified four
risk trajectory groups: decreasing risk (131/534, 24.5% encounters), high risk
(113/534, 21.2%), moderate risk (177/534, 33.1%), and low risk (113/534, 21.2%). 
The decreasing risk group demonstrated change in average probability of
readmission from admission (0.69) to discharge (0.30), whereas the high risk
(0.75), moderate risk (0.61), and low risk (0.39) groups maintained consistency
over the hospital course. A higher level of hemoglobin, larger decrease in
potassium and diastolic blood pressure from admission to discharge, and smaller
number of past hospitalizations are associated with decreasing readmission risk
(P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamically predicting readmission and quantifying trends over
patients' hospital stay illuminated differing risk trajectory groups. Identifying
risk trajectory patterns and distinguishing predictors may shed new light on
indicators of readmission and the isolated effects of the index hospitalization.

asymptomatic to life-threatening courses requires extensive expertise. On the
basis of a selective literature search, this article gives an overview of
selected clinically relevant, acute drug poisonings with regard to epidemiology, 
symptomatology, diagnostics, and therapy.Intoxications with psychotropic drugs
are the most common drug intoxications. Poisoning with tricyclic antidepressants

characterized by serotonin syndrome. Malignant neuroleptic syndrome is a severe
complication of neuroleptic poisoning.Poisoning with analgesics is clinically
relevant due to its high availability. For paracetamol poisoning, intravenous
acetylcysteine is available as an antidote. Hemodialysis may be indicated for
severe salicylate intoxication. Poisoning with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs is usually only associated with mild signs of intoxication.Poisoning with
cardiac drugs (β-blockers and calcium antagonists) can cause life-threatening
cardiovascular events. In addition to symptomatic therapy, insulin glucose
therapy also plays an important role.The majority of acute drug poisonings can be
treated adequately by symptomatic and partly intensive care therapy - if

The angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) reduced cardiovascular
deaths and heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure of
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Its role in non-HFrEF patients was not clear. 
This study aims to answer this question.In this retrospective study, we enrolled 
928 patients diagnosed with non-HFrEF, 492 of them received angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and the rest 436 received
angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. Outcomes were compared by Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and various clinical parameters were investigated using Cox
multivariable analysis, followed by interaction analysis. Minnesota living with
heart failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) was employed as one of the criteria to assess
heart failure outcome.The cardiovascular (CV) death or HF hospitalization at 24
months occurred in 49 patients in ACEI group compared with 31 in ARNI group
(Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.231, 95% confidence Interval (CI): 1.080-2.460, P = .031). 
And ARNI showed better prognosis of HF hospitalization (HR: 1.283, 95%CI:
1.065-1.360, P = .038). Cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates of endpoints, ARNI
could reduce the incidence of CV death or HF hospitalization (P = .042) and HF
hospitalization (P = .035). The stratified analysis revealed that participants
with age less than 70 years old had a lower incidence of CV death or HF
hospitalization (HR: 1.194, 95%CI: 1.011-1992, P = .031) after treated with ARNI.
Patients received diuretics could benefit from ARNI (HR: 1.383, 95%CI:
1.082-1.471, P = .019). Similar results were also observed in patients with heart
rate lower than 90 bpm (HR: 1.556, 95%CI: 1.045-2.386, P = .003) and patients
with atrial fibrillation history (HR: 1.873, 95%CI: 1.420-2.809, P = .011). ARNI

understanding how virtual coaches (ie, coaching program or smart device aiming to
provide coaching support through a variety of application contexts) could be key 
drivers for health promotion in home care settings. As there has been enormous
technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence and data
processing in the past decade, the use of virtual coaches gains an augmented
attention in the considerations of medical innovations.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed at providing an overview of the applications
of a virtual coach in the clinical field. In particular, the review focused on
the papers that provide tangible information for coaching activities with an
active implication for engaging and guiding patients who have an ongoing plan of 
care.
METHODS: We aimed to investigate the use of the term virtual coach in the
clinical field performing a methodical review of the relevant literature indexed 
on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to find virtual coach papers focused on
specific activities dealing with clinical or medical contexts, excluding those
aimed at surgical settings or electronic learning purposes.
RESULTS: After a careful revision of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 46
records were selected for the full-text review. Most of the identified articles
directly or indirectly addressed the topic of physical activity. Some papers were
focused on the use of virtual coaching (VC) to manage overweight or nutritional
issues. Other papers dealt with technological interfaces to facilitate
interactions with patients suffering from different chronic clinical conditions
such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and
chronic pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Although physical activity is a healthy practice that is most
encouraged by a virtual coach system, in the current scenario, rehabilitation is 
the great absentee. This paper gives an overview of the tangible applications of 
this tool in the medical field and may inspire new ideas for future research on
VC.

vessel wall, which is thought to be responsible for disease progression
characterized by a buildup of atherosclerotic plaques. Yet molecular events
responsible for maintenance of plaque inflammation and plaque growth have not
been fully defined. Here we show that endothelial TGFβ signaling is one of the
primary drivers of atherosclerosis-associated vascular inflammation. Inhibition
of endothelial TGFβ signaling in hyperlipidemic mice reduces vessel wall
inflammation and vascular permeability and leads to arrest of disease progression
and regression of established lesions. These pro-inflammatory effects of
endothelial TGFβ signaling are in stark contrast with its effects in other cell
types and identify it as an important driver of atherosclerotic plaque growth and

patterns for prediction in various tasks, and ML methods have been beneficial for
developing prediction models when applied to heterogeneous and large datasets. We
aim to examine the prognostic ability of a ML-based prediction algorithm
utilizing routine health checkup data to predict all-cause mortality (ACM)
compared to established risk prediction approaches.
METHODS: A total 86155 patients with seventy available parameters (35 clinical,
32 laboratory, and 3 coronary artery calcium score [CACS] parameters) were
analyzed. ML involved feature selection, splitting data randomly into a training 
(70%) and test set (30%), and model building with a boosted ensemble algorithm.
The developed ML model was validated in a separate cohort of 4915 patients. The
performance of ML for predicting ACM was compared with the following models: (i) 
the Framingham risk score (FRS) + CACS, (ii) atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) + CACS, with (iii) logistic regression (LR) model.
RESULTS: In the derivation dataset, 690 patients died during the median 4.6-year 
follow-up (interquartile range, 3.0-6.6 years). The AUC value in the ML model was
significantly higher than the other models in test set (ML: 0.82, FRS + CACS:
0.70, ASCVD + CACS: 0.74; LR model: 0.79, p < 0.05 for all), but not
statistically significantly higher in validation set (ML: 0.78, FRS + CACS: 0.62,
ASCVD + CACS: 0.72; LR model: 0.74, p: 0.572 and 0.625 for ASCVD + CACS and LR
model, respectively). The ML model improved reclassification over the other
models in low to intermediate risk patients (p < 0.001 for all).
CONCLUSION: The prediction algorithm derived by ML methods showed a robust
ability to predict ACM and improved reclassification over established
conventional risk prediction approaches in asymptomatic population undergoing a
health checkup.

currently remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a successful example of 
implementing computational techniques for clinically-relevant applications. By
combining electrocardiogram and imaging data, machine learning and high
performance computing simulations, we identified four phenotypes in HCM, with
differences in arrhythmic risk, and provided two distinct possible mechanisms
that may explain the heterogeneity of HCM manifestation. This led to a better HCM
patient stratification and understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms,
providing a step further towards tailored HCM patient management and treatment.

(S1PR1) axis is critically important for lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, 
S1PR1-activation also occurs in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), including those
of the high-endothelial venules (HEVs) that mediate lymphocyte immigration into
lymph nodes (LNs). To understand the functional significance of the S1P/S1PR1-Gi 
axis in HEVs, we generated Lyve1;Spns2Δ/Δ conditional knockout mice for the
S1P-transporter Spinster-homologue-2 (SPNS2), as HEVs express LYVE1 during
development. In these mice HEVs appeared apoptotic and were severely impaired in 
function, morphology and size; leading to markedly hypotrophic peripheral LNs.
Dendritic cells (DCs) were unable to interact with HEVs, which was also observed 
in Cdh5CRE-ERT2;S1pr1Δ/Δ mice and wildtype mice treated with S1PR1-antagonists.
Wildtype HEVs treated with S1PR1-antagonists in vitro and Lyve1-deficient HEVs
show severely reduced release of the DC-chemoattractant CCL21 in vivo. Together, 
our results reveal that EC-derived S1P warrants HEV-integrity through autocrine
control of S1PR1-Gi signaling, and facilitates concomitant HEV-DC interactions.

relevant to diagnosis and management. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made on
a history of delayed allergic reactions to mammalian meat and the blood test for 
IgE to the oligosaccharide α-Gal. In general, the diagnosis also dictates the
primary treatment, that is, avoiding mammalian meat and also dairy in some cases.
In the United States, the lone star tick is the primary cause of this disease,
but different ticks are responsible in other countries. Blood levels of IgE to
α-Gal often drop in patients who avoid recurrent tick bites, but the rate of
decline is variable. Similarly, the delay before reactions is variable and the
severity of the allergic reactions is not predicted by the delay or the titer of 
specific IgE. Some mammalian-derived products such as heart valves, gelatin-based
plasma expanders, and pancreatic enzymes are relevant to only select patient
groups. A minority of cases may benefit from avoiding a wide range of products
that are prepared with mammalian-derived constituents, such as gelatin. This
review focuses on the nature of the syndrome, common challenges in diagnosis and 
management, and also gaps in our current knowledge that would benefit from

prolonged left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support, but its overall
significance with regards to long-term outcomes is unclear. This uncertainty
translates to a lack of consensus regarding the management of AI in this patient 
population-an increasingly pertinent question as more patients are placed on LVAD
support as destination therapy. A retrospective review of a single, high-volume

severity at 6 months, and those with LVAD support of less than 6 months were

right heart failure and functional exercise capacity. At 6 month follow-up 111,
92, and 18 patients had no (0), mild (1), and moderate (2) AI, respectively.
Moderate AI was a significant predictor of 2 year mortality in a multivariable

remains increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Consistent with this,
diabetes mellitus impairs atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering
in humans and mice. In mice, this is attributed in part to hyperglycemia-induced 
monocytosis, which increases monocyte entry into plaques despite cholesterol
lowering. In addition, diabetes mellitus skews plaque macrophages toward an
atherogenic inflammatory M1 phenotype instead of toward the
atherosclerosis-resolving M2 state typical with cholesterol lowering. Functional 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), typically low in patients with diabetes mellitus,
reduces monocyte precursor proliferation in murine bone marrow and has
anti-inflammatory effects on human and murine macrophages. Our study aimed to
test whether raising functional HDL levels in diabetic mice prevents monocytosis,
reduces the quantity and inflammation of plaque macrophages, and enhances
atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering.
METHODS: Aortic arches containing plaques developed in Ldlr-/- mice were
transplanted into either wild-type, diabetic wild-type, or diabetic mice
transgenic for human apolipoprotein AI, which have elevated functional HDL.
Recipient mice all had low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to
promote plaque regression. After 2 weeks, plaques in recipient mouse aortic
grafts were examined.
RESULTS: Diabetic wild-type mice had impaired atherosclerosis regression, which
was normalized by raising HDL levels. This benefit was linked to suppressed
hyperglycemia-driven myelopoiesis, monocytosis, and neutrophilia. Increased HDL
improved cholesterol efflux from bone marrow progenitors, suppressing their
proliferation and monocyte and neutrophil production capacity. In addition to
reducing circulating monocytes available for recruitment into plaques, in the
diabetic milieu, HDL suppressed the general recruitability of monocytes to
inflammatory sites and promoted plaque macrophage polarization to the M2,
atherosclerosis-resolving state. There was also a decrease in plaque neutrophil
extracellular traps, which are atherogenic and increased by diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: Raising apolipoprotein AI and functional levels of HDL promotes
multiple favorable changes in the production of monocytes and neutrophils and in 
the inflammatory environment of atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice after
cholesterol lowering and may represent a novel approach to reduce cardiovascular 
disease risk in people with diabetes mellitus.",Captcha,NaN

red coloration and its periodic variations present specific characteristics in
diabetic patients different from those in control subjects.
Methods: We video recorded the faces of 20 diabetic patients with peripheral
neuropathy, retinopathy, and/or nephropathy and 10 nondiabetic control subjects, 
using a Canon EOS camera, for 240 s. Only one participant presented visible
facial erythema. We applied novel image processing methods to make the facial
redness and its variations visible and automatically detected and extracted the
redness intensity of eight facial patches, from each frame. We compared average
and standard deviations of redness in the two groups using t-tests.
Results: Facial redness varies, imperceptibly and periodically, between redder
and paler, following the heart pulsation. This variation is consistently and
significantly larger in diabetic patients compared to controls (p value < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our study and its results (i.e., larger variations of facial redness
with the heartbeats in diabetic patients) are unprecedented. One limitation is
the sample size. Confirmation in a larger study would ground the development of a
noninvasive cost-effective automatic tool for early detection of diabetic
complications, based on measuring invisible redness variations, by image
processing of facial videos captured at home with the patient's smartphone.

values are related to atherogenic indexes (AIs) and could predict the risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in southern Taiwanese adults.
Methods: Medical records of 3249 adults who underwent health examinations between
June 2014 and February 2018 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan were
reviewed. Data collected included health history, anthropomorphic
characteristics, exercise habits, diets (vegetarian or nonvegetarian), clinical
laboratory results (lipid profile, systemic blood pressure (SBP), glucose level, 
creatinine (Cre) level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level), and bone mineral density
(BMD), which were used to identify the associations of these parameters,
especially BMD, with lipid profile and calculated AIs through simple and multiple
linear regressions.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 58.0 years, and 71.4% were male. Body
mass index (BMI), SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, and all BMD values
were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG) level and AIs and were
negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level.
The significant positive correlations of BMD at all the measured sites with AIs
remained after adjusting for age, sex, SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level,
smoking, exercise habits, and vegetarian state. The expanded adjusting model for 
TG/HDL-C remained significant at all the BMD measured sites in nonobese men, at
bilateral femoral neck and total hips in nonobese women, and at the bilateral
total hips in obese women.
Conclusions: AIs are predictive markers for CVD, and BMD values are predictors of
AIs, especially the novel AI, i.e., TG/HDL-C ratio, in nonobese adult men and
women after dividing the patients into subgroups to eliminate the effect of BMI
as a confounding factor. Thus, BMD values could predict AIs of CVD, especially in
nonobese adults.

flow is driven by muscle contraction working in conjunction with valves.
Accordingly, defective lymphatic valve morphogenesis results in backflow leading

lymphatic valves, a precedent that currently persists, raising the question of
whether the zebrafish could be used to study the development of these structures.
Here, we provide functional and morphological evidence of valves in the zebrafish
lymphatic system. Electron microscopy revealed valve ultrastructure similar to
mammals, while live imaging using transgenic lines identified the developmental
origins of lymphatic valve progenitors. Zebrafish embryos bearing mutations in
genes required for mammalian valve morphogenesis show defective lymphatic valve
formation and edema. Together, our observations provide a foundation from which

mechanical environment. In receptor-mediated mechanosensing, cell surface
receptors interact with immobilized ligands to provide a specific way to receive

force-supporting structures inside the cell. Conversely, forces generated
endogenously by the cell can be transmitted via cytoplasmic protein-protein
interactions and regulate cell surface receptor activities in an 'inside-out'
manner. Dynamic force spectroscopy analyzes these interactions on and inside
cells to reveal various dynamic bonds. What is more, by integrating analysis of
molecular interactions with that of cell signaling events involved in
force-sensing and force-responding processes, one can investigate how dynamic
bonds regulate the reception, transmission and transduction of mechanical

waveform analysis and allow real-time accurate identification of damping.
BACKGROUND: Damping of aortic pressure during coronary angiography must be
identified to avoid serious complications and make accurate coronary physiology
measurements. There are currently no automated methods to do this, and so
identification of damping requires constant monitoring, which is prone to human
error.
METHODS: The neural network was trained and tested versus core laboratory expert 
opinions derived from 2 separate datasets. A total of 5,709 aortic pressure
waveforms of individual heart beats were extracted and classified. The study
developed a recurrent convolutional neural network to classify beats as either
normal, showing damping, or artifactual. Accuracies were reported using the
opinions of 2 independent core laboratories.
RESULTS: The neural network was 99.4% accurate (95% confidence interval: 98.8% to
99.6%) at classifying beats from the testing dataset when judged against the
opinions of the internal core laboratory. It was 98.7% accurate (95% confidence
interval: 98.0% to 99.2%) when judged against the opinions of an external core
laboratory not involved in neural network training. The neural network was 100%
sensitive, with no beats classified as damped misclassified, with a specificity
of 99.8%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 98.1% and
99.5%. The 2 core laboratories agreed more closely with the neural network than
with each other.
CONCLUSIONS: Arterial waveform analysis using neural networks allows rapid and
accurate identification of damping. This demonstrates how machine learning can
assist with patient safety and the quality control of procedures.

(PWV).
METHODS: We retrospectively selected subjects who had undergone treatment in an
outpatient or inpatient clinic. The subjects were sub-grouped into four groups:
Group A (no history of hypertension and dyslipidemia), Group B (a history of
dyslipidemia but not hypertension), Group C (a history of hypertension but not
dyslipidemia) and Group D (a history of both hypertension and dyslipidemia). We
determined brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), atherogenic index of
plasma (AIP), non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol/high
density lipoprotein (TC/HDL-C) and atherogenic indices (AI) for hypertension and 
non-hypertension and dyslipidemia and non-dyslipidemia patients.
RESULTS: A total of 380 subjects were included. Uric acid, systolic pressure,
diastolic pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly 
different among the groups. The prevalence of coronary arterial disease and
diabetes mellitus, age, body mass index, heart rate, blood glucose, creatinine,
urea, smoking history and alcohol consumption did not differ among groups. The
baPWV was significantly different between both hypertension/nonhypertension and
dyslipidemia/non-dyslipidemia patients. In hypertension patients (in Group C and 
D), partial correlation analysis showed that ΔbaPWV correlated with TC, HDL-C,
AI, AIP and TC/HDL-C but not LDL-C, triglyceride (TG) or non-HDL-C.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension and/or dyslipidemia may be risk factors for arterial
stiffness. In hypertension patients, TC, HDL-C, AIP, AI and TC/HDL-C might
correlate to arterial stiffness and pathological increases in these levels may
indicate risk factors for arterial stiffness.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31563160,Nan

therapy based on phenotyping with plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma
aldosterone significantly improves blood pressure control. Patients with a
low-renin/low aldosterone (Liddle) phenotype respond best to amiloride, while
those with low-renin/high aldosterone respond best to aldosterone antagonists,
and those with high renin/high aldosterone (renal phenotype) respond best to
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). However, it is important to measure PRA in a
stimulated condition to distinguish between low levels due to high salt intake,
licorice or nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs and low levels due to suppression by 
excess aldosterone secretion or renal tubular genetic variants causing retention 
of salt and water (Liddle phenotype). In the past, both diuretics and angiotensin
converting inhibitors (ACEi) have been used for this purpose, and it has been
assumed that these classes of drugs are equivalent. In this study of 2896
patients with hypertension, we evaluated that assumption. We found important
differences among diuretics alone, ACEi/ARB alone, and ACEi/ARB + diuretics,
which all stimulated PRA. However, ACEi/ARB lowers plasma aldosterone, and beta
blockers lower PRA. Among patients with systolic pressure ≥ 180 mmHg ± diastolic 
pressure ≥ 100 mmHg stimulated only by diuretics, the phenotypes were 25% Liddle,
38% IA, 8.7% renal, and 28.3% mixed. In choosing physiologically individualized

continuous immunosuppressive therapy and toxic effects remains a difficult task
in clinical organ transplantation. Transplant immunologists have developed
numerous experimental treatments that target antigen-presentation (signal 1),
costimulation (signal 2), and cytokine production (signal 3) to establish
transplantation tolerance. While promising results have been obtained using
therapeutic approaches that predominantly target the adaptive immune response,
the long-term graft survival rates remain suboptimal. This suggests the existence
of unrecognized allograft rejection mechanisms that contribute to organ failure. 
We postulate that trained immunity stimulatory pathways are critical to the
immune response that mediates graft loss. Trained immunity is a recently
discovered functional program of the innate immune system, which is characterized
by nonpermanent epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. Since
trained macrophages upregulate costimulatory molecules (signal 2) and produce
pro-inflammatory cytokines (signal 3), they contribute to potent graft reactive
immune responses and organ transplant rejection. In this review, we summarize the
detrimental effects of trained immunity in the context of organ transplantation
and describe pathways that induce macrophage training associated with graft
rejection.

Hotspot mutation at Arg132 in IDH1 that alters the function of IDH1 by further
converting the α-ketoglutarate(α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) have been
identified in a variety of cancers. Because the IDH1 mutations occur in a
significant portion of gliomas and glioblastomas, it is important that IDH1
inhibitors have to be brain penetrant to treat IDH1-mutant brain tumors. Here we 
report the efforts to design and synthesize a novel serial of mutant IDH1
inhibitors with improved activity and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. 
We show that compound 5 exhibits good brain exposure and potent 2-HG inhibition

develop multi-functional agents. Herein, we have designed and synthesized
molecular hybrids of 2-pyridylpiperazine and 5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
Biological activities of synthesized compounds suggested significant and balanced
inhibitory potential against target enzymes. In particular, compound 49

potential lead with inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (hAChE, IC50 = 0.054 μM), 
butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE, IC50 = 0.787 μM) and beta-secretase-1 (hBACE-1,

type of inhibition (Ki = 0.030 μM). Also, 48 and 49 showed significant
displacement of propidium iodide from the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of hAChE,
excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in parallel artificial membrane 
permeation assay (PAMPA), and neuroprotective ability against SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cell lines. Further, 49 also exhibited anti-Aβ aggregation activity
in self- and AChE-induced thioflavin T assay, which was ascertained by
morphological characterization by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover,
in vivo behavioral studies signified learning and memory improvement by compound 
49 in scopolamine- and Aβ-induced cognitive dysfunctions performed on Y-maze and

milk prevent retinopathy of prematurity? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 13-19. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the risk factors for Retinopathy of Prematurity 
(ROP) development and the potential effect of human breast milk among these
factors. For this purpose, infants admitted to a tertiary referral clinic for ROP
screening and treatment between April 2013 and May 2015, were included in this
retrospective study. The demographic data, accompanying diseases, previous
surgery, type of feeding and duration of human breast milk intake were recorded. 
According to the ROP screening examination results, infants were divided into two
groups as those with ROP (infants at any stage of ROP) and those without ROP.
Relationship between the risk factors and ROP were evaluated. The comparison of
221 infants without ROP and 99 infants with ROP; revealed that gestational age at
birth, birth weight, mechanical ventilation support, bronchopulmonary and cardiac
diseases, hydrocephaly, any previous surgery, infections, steroid treatment
percentages were high and human breast milk intake percentage was low among
infants with ROP. Mean breast feeding time for infants with ROP (3.81 ± 2.33
month) was shorter than the infants without ROP (5.51 ± 1.43 month) (p < 0.001). 
In logistic regression analysis, the duration of breast feeding was inversely
related with ROP (OR 0.744; 95% CI 0.621-0.891; p < 0,001). These results suggest
that gestational age at birth and accompanying diseases are the main risk factors
for the development of ROP. As the duration of the breast feeding of the infants

at single ablation lesions, calculated by integration of ablation time, energy,
catheter stability, and contact force, has been documented to be associated with 
effective lesions and higher ablation efficacy. Using a prespecified target AI in
addition to acute lesion efficacy may affect local collateral damage like
esophageal thermal injury when used for guiding radiofrequency (RF) ablation at
the posterior left atrial (LA) wall.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients undergoing first AF ablations using AI 
were included. Ablation energy was reduced to 25 W when ablating at posterior LA 
wall. Two different individually defined AI target values were used (300 and 350 
for posterior wall ablation). Esophageal endoscopy (EE) was performed 1 to 3 days
after ablation procedure to document and categorize endoscopically detected
esophageal thermal lesion (EDEL). Two-hundred and eleven consecutive patients
with postprocedural EE were included. Incidence of EDEL was 14% (29 of 211
patients; mild category 1 lesions in 22 of 29 patients (76%) and severe category 
2 lesions (ulcers > 5 mm) in 7 of 29 patients (24% of EDEL group, 3% of total
group). Ablation time at posterior LA wall (9.5 vs 9.0 minutes [P = .67]) was
comparable in patients with and without EDEL.
CONCLUSION: LA posterior wall RF ablation adopting AI ≤350 was associated with
14% esophageal thermal injury including 3% of severe esophageal thermal ulcers.
This incidence is comparable to historic control groups with non AI-guided AF
ablation.

on six specific questions. After considering the balance of desirable and
undesirable consequences, quality of evidence, feasibility, and acceptability of 
various interventions, the Task Force made the following recommendations: 1)
suggest using anti-interleukin (IL)-5 and anti-IL-5 receptor α for severe
uncontrolled adult eosinophilic asthma phenotypes; 2) suggest using a blood
eosinophil cut-point ≥150 μL-1 to guide anti-IL-5 initiation in adult patients
with severe asthma; 3) suggest considering specific eosinophil (≥260 μL-1) and
exhaled nitric oxide fraction (≥19.5 ppb) cut-offs to identify adolescents or
adults with the greatest likelihood of response to anti-IgE therapy; 4) suggest
using inhaled tiotropium for adolescents and adults with severe uncontrolled
asthma despite Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4-5 or National Asthma
Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) step 5 therapies; 5) suggest a trial of 
chronic macrolide therapy to reduce asthma exacerbations in persistently
symptomatic or uncontrolled patients on GINA step 5 or NAEPP step 5 therapies,
irrespective of asthma phenotype; and 6) suggest using anti-IL-4/13 for adult
patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and for those with severe
corticosteroid-dependent asthma regardless of blood eosinophil levels. These
recommendations should be reconsidered as new evidence becomes available.

offers an opportunity to impact both lung cancer and coronary heart disease
mortality through detection of coronary artery calcification (CAC). Here, we
explore the value of CAC and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment in LCS 
participants in the Lung Screen Uptake Trial (LSUT).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, current and ex-smokers aged 60-75 were
invited to a 'lung health check'. Data collection included a CVD risk assessment 
enabling estimation of 10 year CVD risk using the QRISK2 score. Participants
meeting the required lung cancer risk underwent an ungated, non-contrast LDCT.
Descriptive data, bivariate associations and a multivariate analysis of
predictors of statin use are presented.
RESULTS: Of 1005 individuals enrolled, 680 were included in the final analysis.
421 (61.9%) had CAC present and in 49 (7.2%), this was heavy. 668 (98%) of
participants had a QRISK2≥10% and QRISK2 was positively associated with
increasing CAC grade (OR 4.29 (CI 0.93 to 19.88) for QRISK2=10%-20% and 12.29 (CI
2.68 to 56.1) for QRISK2≥20% respectively). Of those who qualified for statin
primary prevention (QRISK2≥10%), 56.8% did not report a history of statin use. In
the multivariate analysis statin use was associated with age, body mass index and
history of hypertension and diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: LCS offers an important opportunity for instituting CVD risk
assessment in all LCS participants irrespective of the presence of LDCT-detected 
CAC. Further studies are needed to determine whether CAC could enhance uptake and
adherence to primary preventative strategies.

at increased risk for pulmonary fibrosis. We assessed the prevalence and risk
factors for preclinical pulmonary fibrosis (PrePF) in first-degree relatives of
patients with FIP and determined the utility of deep learning in detecting PrePF 
on CT.
METHODS: First-degree relatives of patients with FIP over 40 years of age who
believed themselves to be unaffected by pulmonary fibrosis underwent CT scans of 
the chest. Images were visually reviewed, and a deep learning algorithm was used 
to quantify lung fibrosis. Genotyping for common idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
risk variants in MUC5B and TERT was performed.
FINDINGS: In 494 relatives of patients with FIP from 263 families of patients
with FIP, the prevalence of PrePF on visual CT evaluation was 15.6% (95% CI 12.6 
to 19.0). Compared with visual CT evaluation, deep learning quantitative CT
analysis had 84% sensitivity (95% CI 0.72 to 0.89) and 86% sensitivity (95% CI
0.83 to 0.89) for discriminating subjects with visual PrePF diagnosis. Subjects
with PrePF were older (65.9, SD 10.1 years) than subjects without fibrosis (55.8 
SD 8.7 years), more likely to be male (49% vs 37%), more likely to have smoked
(44% vs 27%) and more likely to have the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 (minor
allele frequency 0.29 vs 0.21). MUC5B variant carriers had higher quantitative CT
fibrosis scores (mean difference of 0.36%), a difference that remains significant
when controlling for age and sex.
INTERPRETATION: PrePF is common in relatives of patients with FIP. Its prevalence
increases with age and the presence of a common MUC5B promoter variant.
Quantitative CT analysis can detect these imaging abnormalities.

patients undergoing surgery, especially cardiac surgery. It is strongly
associated with major adverse events, which in turn leads to increased cost and
poor outcomes (eg, need for nursing home due to cognitive impairment, stroke, and
death). The ability to foresee patients at risk of delirium will guide the timely
initiation of multimodal preventive interventions, which will aid in reducing the
burden and negative consequences associated with delirium. Several studies have
focused on the prediction of delirium. However, the number of studies in cardiac 
surgical patients that have used machine learning methods is very limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the application of several machine
learning predictive models that can pre-emptively predict delirium in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery and compare their performance.
METHODS: We investigated a number of machine learning methods to develop models
that can predict delirium after cardiac surgery. A clinical dataset comprising
over 5000 actual patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a single center was
used to develop the models using logistic regression, artificial neural networks 
(ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian belief networks (BBN), naïve
Bayesian, random forest, and decision trees.
RESULTS: Only 507 out of 5584 patients (11.4%) developed delirium. We addressed
the underlying class imbalance, using random undersampling, in the training
dataset. The final prediction performance was validated on a separate test
dataset. Owing to the target class imbalance, several measures were used to
evaluate algorithm's performance for the delirium class on the test dataset. Out 
of the selected algorithms, the SVM algorithm had the best F1 score for positive 
cases, kappa, and positive predictive value (40.2%, 29.3%, and 29.7%,
respectively) with a P=.01, .03, .02, respectively. The ANN had the best
receiver-operator area-under the curve (78.2%; P=.03). The BBN had the best
precision-recall area-under the curve for detecting positive cases (30.4%;
P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is inherently complex, preventive measures to
mitigate its negative effect can be applied proactively if patients at risk are
prospectively identified. Our results highlight 2 important points: (1)
addressing class imbalance on the training dataset will augment machine learning 
model's performance in identifying patients likely to develop postoperative
delirium, and (2) as the prediction of postoperative delirium is difficult
because it is multifactorial and has complex pathophysiology, applying machine
learning methods (complex or simple) may improve the prediction by revealing
hidden patterns, which will lead to cost reduction by prevention of complications
and will optimize patients' outcomes.

nature that remains poorly understood. The objective was to use whole genome
sequencing (WGS) data to identify regions of common genetic variation
contributing to lung function in individuals with a diagnosis of asthma.
METHODS: WGS data were generated for 1,053 individuals from trios and extended
pedigrees participating in the family-based Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in
Costa Rica study. Asthma affection status was defined through a physician's
diagnosis of asthma, and most participants with asthma also had airway
hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to methacholine. Family-based association tests for
single variants were performed to assess the associations with lung function
phenotypes.
RESULTS: A genome-wide significant association was identified between baseline
FEV1/FVC ratio and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the top hit cysteine-rich 
secretory protein LCCL domain-containing 2 (CRISPLD2) (rs12051168; P = 3.6 × 10-8
in the unadjusted model) that retained suggestive significance in the
covariate-adjusted model (P = 5.6 × 10-6). Rs12051168 was also nominally
associated with other related phenotypes: baseline FEV1 (P = 3.3 × 10-3),
postbronchodilator (PB) FEV1 (7.3 × 10-3), and PB FEV1/FVC ratio (P = 2.7 ×
10-3). The identified baseline FEV1/FVC ratio and rs12051168 association was
meta-analyzed and replicated in three independent cohorts in which most
participants with asthma also had confirmed AHR (combined weighted z-score P =
.015) but not in cohorts without information about AHR.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that using specific asthma characteristics,
such as AHR, can help identify more genetically homogeneous asthma subgroups with
genotype-phenotype associations that may not be observed in all children with
asthma. CRISPLD2 also may be important for baseline lung function in individuals 
with asthma who also may have AHR.

detection of adverse cardiovascular events without requiring repeated check-ups
in a clinical environment. The proposed method was tested in an in-vitro flow
loop which allowed simulating a failing aortic valve in a laboratory setting.
Aortic regurgitation of increasing severity was deliberately introduced with
tube-shaped inserts, preventing complete valve closure during diastole. Blood
flow recordings from a flow meter at the location of the ascending aorta were
analyzed with the algorithms introduced in this article and a diagnostic index
was defined that reflects the severity of valvular degradation. The results
indicate that the proposed methodology offers a high sensitivity towards
pathological changes of valvular function and that it is capable of automatically
identifying valvular degradation. Such methods may be a step towards
computer-assisted diagnostics and telemedicine that provide the clinician with
novel tools to improve patient care.",Captcha,NaN

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cardiovascular and sedation reversal effects of IM 
administration of atipamezole (AA) in dogs treated with medetomidine
hydrochloride (MED) or MED and vatinoxan (MK-467).
ANIMALS: 8 purpose-bred, 2-year-old Beagles.
PROCEDURES: A randomized, blinded, crossover study was performed in which each
dog received 2 IM treatments at a ≥ 2-week interval as follows: injection of MED 
(20 μg/kg) or MED mixed with 400 μg of vatinoxan/kg (MEDVAT) 30 minutes before AA
(100 μg/kg). Sedation score, heart rate, mean arterial and central venous blood
pressures, and cardiac output were recorded before and at various time points (up
to 90 minutes) after AA. Cardiac and systemic vascular resistance indices were
calculated. Venous blood samples were collected at intervals until 210 minutes
after AA for drug concentration analysis.
RESULTS: Heart rate following MED administration was lower, compared with
findings after MEDVAT administration, prior to and at ≥ 10 minutes after AA. Mean
arterial blood pressure was lower with MEDVAT than with MED at 5 minutes after
AA, when its nadir was detected. Overall, cardiac index was higher and systemic
vascular resistance index lower, indicating better cardiovascular function, in
MEDVAT-atipamezole-treated dogs. Plasma dexmedetomidine concentrations were lower
and recoveries from sedation were faster and more complete after MEDVAT treatment
with AA than after MED treatment with AA.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Atipamezole failed to restore heart rate and 
cardiac index in medetomidine-sedated dogs, and relapses into sedation were
observed. Coadministration of vatinoxan with MED helped to maintain hemodynamic
function and hastened the recovery from sedation after AA in dogs.",Captcha,NaN

variability analysis showed that the normalized low frequency (LF) and LF/high

condition, while the normalized HF parameter significantly increased under the
-3% stimulation condition. In addition, the HR density around the stimulus BPM
significantly increased under the -3% stimulation condition. The results confirm

patients than among white patients, and black patients constitute the minority of
participants in trials informing treatment. Data indicate that patients with
inadequately controlled asthma benefit more from addition of a long-acting
beta-agonist (LABA) than from increased glucocorticoids; however, these data may 
not be informative for treatment in black patients.
METHODS: We conducted two prospective, randomized, double-blind trials: one
involving children and the other involving adolescents and adults. In both
trials, the patients had at least one grandparent who identified as black and had
asthma that was inadequately controlled with low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. We
compared combinations of therapy, which included the addition of a LABA
(salmeterol) to an inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), a step-up to 
double to quintuple the dose of fluticasone, or both. The treatments were
compared with the use of a composite measure that evaluated asthma exacerbations,
asthma-control days, and lung function; data were stratified according to
genotypic African ancestry.
RESULTS: When quintupling the dose of fluticasone (to 250 μg twice a day) was
compared with adding salmeterol (50 μg twice a day) and doubling the fluticasone 
(to 100 μg twice a day), a superior response occurred in 46% of the children with
quintupling the fluticasone and in 46% of the children with doubling the
fluticasone and adding salmeterol (P = 0.99). In contrast, more adolescents and
adults had a superior response to added salmeterol than to an increase in
fluticasone (salmeterol-low-dose fluticasone vs. medium-dose fluticasone, 49% vs.
28% [P = 0.003]; salmeterol-medium-dose fluticasone vs. high-dose fluticasone,
49% vs. 31% [P = 0.02]). Neither the degree of African ancestry nor baseline
biomarkers predicted a superior response to specific treatments. The increased
dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was associated with a decrease in the ratio of
urinary cortisol to creatinine in children younger than 8 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to black adolescents and adults, almost half the black
children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in 
the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to 
the addition of a LABA. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;

the present review updates the knowledge on the structure-activity relationships

activators, such as menadione analogues, helped to understand the critical
moieties required for HO-2 activation. Recent advances in the potential
therapeutic applications of HO-2 inhibitors/activators cover the fields of
neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and reproductive diseases

Background Direct intraindividual comparison of dynamic CT myocardial perfusion
imaging (MPI) and machine learning (ML)-based CT fractional flow reserve (FFR)
has not been explored for diagnosing hemodynamically significant coronary artery 
disease. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic performance of dynamic CT MPI and 
ML-based CT FFR for functional assessment of coronary stenosis. Materials and
Methods Between January 2, 2017, and October 17, 2018, consecutive participants
with stable angina were prospectively enrolled. All participants underwent
dynamic CT MPI coronary CT angiography and invasive conventional coronary
angiography (CCA) FFR within 2 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis was used to assess diagnostic performance. Results Eighty-six
participants (mean age, 67 years ± 12 [standard deviation]; 67 men) with 157
target vessels were included for final analysis. The mean radiation doses for
dynamic CT MPI and coronary CT angiography were 3.6 mSv ± 1.1 and 2.7 mSv ± 0.8, 
respectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was lower in ischemic segments compared
with nonischemic segments and reference segments (defined as the territory of
vessels without stenosis) (75 mL/100 mL/min ± 20 vs 148 mL/100 mL/min ± 22 and
169 mL/100 mL/min ± 34, respectively, both P < .001). Similarly, CT FFR was also 
lower for hemodynamically significant lesions than for hemodynamically
nonsignificant lesions (0.68 ± 0.1 vs 0.83 ± 0.1, respectively, P < .001). MBF
had the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) (using 99 mL/100 mL/min as a
cutoff) among all parameters, outperforming ML-based CT FFR (AUC = 0.97 vs 0.85, 
P < .001). The vessel-based specificity and diagnostic accuracy of MBF were
higher than those of ML-based CT FFR (93% vs 68%, P < .001 and 94% vs 78%,
respectively, P = .04) whereas the sensitivity of both methods was similar (96%
vs 88%, respectively, P = .11). Conclusion Dynamic CT myocardial perfusion
imaging was able to help accurately evaluate the hemodynamic significance of
coronary stenosis using a reduced amount of radiation. In addition, the
myocardial blood flow derived from dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging
outperformed machine learning-based CT fractional flow reserve for identifying
lesions causing ischemia. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available

leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that contributes to organ
failure and death. Fondaparinux (FPX) is a synthetic pentasaccharide that binds
to antithrombin (AT) and selectively inhibits factor (F) Xa and other upstream
coagulation proteases but not thrombin (T).
OBJECTIVES: We used a baboon model of lethal Escherichia coli sepsis to
investigate the effects of FPX treatment on DIC, organ function, and outcome.
METHODS: Two experimental groups were studied: (a) E. coli challenge (n = 4); and
(b) E coli plus FPX (n = 4). Bacteremia was modeled by intravenous infusion of
pathogen (1-2 × 1010  CFU/kg). Fondaparinux (0.08 mg/kg) was administered
subcutaneously, 3 h prior to and 8 h after bacteria infusion.
RESULTS: Bacteremia rapidly increased plasma levels of inhibitory complexes of AT
with coagulation proteases. Activation markers of both intrinsic (FXIa-AT), and
extrinsic (FVIIa-AT) pathways were significantly reduced in FPX-treated animals. 
Factor Xa-AT and TAT complexes were maximal at 4 to 8 h post challenge and
reduced >50% in FPX-treated animals. Fibrinogen consumption, fibrin generation
and degradation, neutrophil and complement activation, and cytokine production
were strongly induced by sepsis. All parameters were significantly reduced, while
platelet count was unchanged by the treatment. Fondaparinux infusion attenuated
organ dysfunction, prolonged survival, and saved two of four challenged animals
(log-rank Mantel-Cox test, P = .0067).
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that FPX-mediated inhibition of coagulation
prevents sepsis coagulopathy; protects against excessive complement activation,
inflammation, and organ dysfunction; and provides survival benefit in E. coli
sepsis.

cholesterol, triglyceride, and homocysteine levels were similar in the 2 groups
(P > 0.05), whereas the plasma TAFI antigen levels were significantly elevated in
the acromegalic patients (154.7 ± 94.0%) when compared with the control subjects

Pearson’s correlation test between the plasma TAFI antigen and homocysteine
levels (r = 0.320, P = 0.250).
Conclusion: A significant alteration in the plasma TAFI antigen levels was
detected in acromegaly. Increased plasma TAFI antigen levels might aggravate
prothrombotic and thrombotic events in patients with acromegaly.

METHODS: A self-supervised convolutional neural network-based algorithm was
trained on a dataset of 475 manually structured CTPA reports. Labels for
individual statements included ""pulmonary arteries,"" ""lungs and airways,""
""pleura,"" ""mediastinum and lymph nodes,"" ""cardiovascular,"" ""soft tissues and

accuracy was calculated based on strict criteria (algorithm label counted as
correct if the statement unequivocally contained content only related to that
particular label) and a modified criteria, accounting for problematic statements,
including typographical errors, statements that did not fit well into the

learning (ML) has great potential, but is currently hindered by poor
generalizability. Comparison is traditionally against clinicians as a reference, 
ignoring inherent human inter- and intraobserver error, and ensuring that ML
cannot demonstrate superiority. Measuring precision (scan:rescan reproducibility)
addresses this. We compared precision of ML and humans using a multicenter,
multi-disease, scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance data set.
METHODS: One hundred ten patients (5 disease categories, 5 institutions, 2
scanner manufacturers, and 2 field strengths) underwent scan:rescan
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (96% within one week). After identification of 
the most precise human technique, left ventricular chamber volumes, mass, and
ejection fraction were measured by an expert, a trained junior clinician, and a
fully automated convolutional neural network trained on 599 independent
multicenter disease cases. Scan:rescan coefficient of variation and 1000
bootstrapped 95% CIs were calculated and compared using mixed linear effects
models.
RESULTS: Clinicians can be confident in detecting a 9% change in left ventricular
ejection fraction, with greater than half of coefficient of variation
attributable to intraobserver variation. Expert, trained junior, and automated
scan:rescan precision were similar (for left ventricular ejection fraction,
coefficient of variation 6.1 [5.2%-7.1%], P=0.2581; 8.3 [5.6%-10.3%], P=0.3653;

precise human techniques, even when challenged with real-world scan:rescan data.

treat patients who have heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction.
However, adherence to these medications is often suboptimal, which places
patients at increased risk for poor health outcomes, including hospitalization.
We aimed to examine the association between adherence to these medications and
potentially preventable HF hospitalizations among younger insured adults with
newly diagnosed HF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the 2008-2012 IBM MarketScan Commercial database, we
followed 26,439 individuals aged 18-64 years with newly diagnosed HF and
calculated their adherence (using the proportion of days covered (PDC) algorithm)
to the five guideline-recommended medication categories: angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers; beta blockers; aldosterone
receptor antagonists; hydralazine; and isosorbide dinitrate. We determined the
association between PDC and long-term preventable HF hospitalizations
(observation years 3-5) as defined by the United States (U.S.) Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality. Overall, 49.0% of enrollees had good adherence
(PDC≥80%), which was more common among enrollees who were older, male, residing
in higher income counties, initially diagnosed with HF in an outpatient setting, 
and who filled prescriptions for fewer medication categories assessed. Adherence 
differed by medication category and was lowest for isosorbide dinitrate (PDC =
60.7%). In total, 7.6% of enrollees had preventable HF hospitalizations. Good
adherers, compared to poor adherers (PDC<40%), were 15% less likely to have a
preventable hospitalization (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.96).
CONCLUSION: We found that approximately half of insured U.S. adults aged 18-64
years with newly diagnosed HF had good adherence to their HF medications.
Patients with good adherence, compared to those with poor adherence, were less
likely to have a potentially preventable HF hospitalization 3-5 years after their
initial diagnosis. Because HF is a chronic condition that requires long-term
management, future studies may want to assess the effectiveness of interventions 
in sustaining adherence.",Captcha,NaN

Assessment of physiological instability preceding adverse events on hospital
wards has been previously investigated through clinical early warning score
systems. Early warning scores are simple to use yet they consider data as
independent and identically distributed random variables. Deep learning
applications are able to learn from sequential data, however they lack
interpretability and are thus difficult to deploy in clinical settings. We
propose the 'Deep Early Warning System' (DEWS), an interpretable end-to-end deep 
learning model that interpolates temporal data and predicts the probability of an
adverse event, defined as the composite outcome of cardiac arrest, mortality or
unplanned ICU admission. The model was developed and validated using routinely
collected vital signs of patients admitted to the the Oxford University Hospitals
between 21st March 2014 and 31st March 2018. We extracted 45,314 vital-sign
measurements as a balanced training set and 359,481 vital-sign measurements as an
imbalanced testing set to mimic a real-life setting of emergency admissions. DEWS
achieved superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art that is currently
implemented in clinical settings, the National Early Warning Score, in terms of
the overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (0.880
vs. 0.866) and when evaluated independently for each of the three outcomes. Our
attention-based architecture was able to recognize 'historical' trends in the
data that are most correlated with the predicted probability. With high
sensitivity, improved clinical utility and increased interpretability, our model 
can be easily deployed in clinical settings to supplement existing EWS systems.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31545746.pdf

myocardium and ablation index (AI) correlates with RF lesion depth and width in
normal-voltage (>1.5 mV) myocardium (NVM). We investigate the impact of CF on RF 
lesion depth and width in low (<0.5 mV) (LVM) and intermediate-voltage (0.5-1.5
mV) myocardium (IVM) following myocardial infarction. Correlation between RF
lesion depth and width evaluated by native contrast magnetic resonance imaging
(ncMRI) and gross anatomical evaluation was investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve weeks after myocardial infarction, 10 pigs underwent 
electroanatomical mapping and endocardial RF ablations were deployed in NVM, IVM,
and LVM myocardium. In vivo ncMRI was performed before the heart was excised and 
subjected to gross anatomical evaluation. Ninety (82%) RF lesions were evaluated.
Radiofrequency lesion depth and width were smaller in IVM and LVM compared with
NVM (P < 0.001). Radiofrequency lesion depth and width correlated with CF, AI,
and impedance drop in NVM (CF and AI P < 0.001) and IVM (CF and AI depths
P < 0.001; CF and AI widths P < 0.05). Native contrast magnetic resonance imaging
evaluated RF lesion depth and width correlated with gross anatomical depth and
width (NVM and IVM P < 0.001; LVM P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency lesions deployed by similar duration, power and CF
are smaller in IVM and LVM than in NVM. Radiofrequency lesion depth and width
correlated with CF, AI, and impedance drop in NVM and IVM but not in LVM. Native 
contrast magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to assess RF lesion depth and
width in NVM, IVM, and LVM.

functional limitations and multiple comorbidities, predisposing them to trauma.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to identify patient characteristics, hospital
complications, and comorbidities that predict in-hospital mortality in the
nonagenarian population following trauma. We also sought to create a scoring
system using these variables.
Settings and Design: This study was a retrospective chart review.
Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 548 nonagenarian trauma patients
admitted to two Level I trauma centers from 2006 to 2015. Statistical analysis
was performed using logistic regression and a machine learning model, which
calculated significant variables and computed a scoring system.
Results: The in-hospital mortality rate was 7.1% (n = 39). Significant predictors
of mortality were cardiac comorbidity, neuro-concussion, New Injury Severity

complications. Significant variables were assigned a numeric value. A score of 5+
carried a 41.1% mortality risk, 79% sensitivity, and 91% specificity. A score of

oral anticoagulation like aspirin (ASS), direct platelet aggregation inhibitors
like Clopidogrel and Ticagrelor (PAI), vitamin-K-antagonists like Warfarin (VKA) 
and direct oral anticoagulants like Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran and Apixaban (DOAC). 
The management and timing of fracture stabilization of these patients is a rising
challenge in orthopedic trauma. Our objective was to determine the effect of oral
anticoagulation on patients with proximal femur fractures, which received a
proximal femur nail antirotation (PFNA) within 24 h after trauma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 327 patients (mean age
80 ± 13 years; 223 women and 104 men) with sub- or intertrochanteric fractures
between January 2013 and December 2017 was performed. All patients underwent
surgery in the first 24 h after admission. Solely patients without or with only
one type of oral anticoagulation were included. There were 74 patients with ASS, 
30 with PAI, 52 with DOAC and 25 with VKA medication. All patients taking VKA
received high dose Vitamin K or coagulation factors to normalize INR prior to
surgery. Primary outcome measures were transfusion rate and pre- and
postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) difference. Secondary outcome measures were
mortality and complications like infection, hematoma and acute cardiovascular
events.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing treatment with DOAC had a 3.4-fold increased risk
for intraoperative blood transfusion. The risk for blood transfusion for patients
taking ASS, PAI or VKA did no differ from the control group. Patients without an 
intraoperative blood transfusion on oral anticoagulation showed no increase in
pre- and postoperative Hb-difference compared with controls. Anticoagulation
showed no significant effect on complication rates and mortality in patients
operated within the first 24 h.
CONCLUSION: Early surgical care of proximal femur fractures is safe even in
patients with anticoagulant medication. All patients should be preoperatively
prepared for possibly intraoperative transfusion, especially patients on DOAC.

The
atrial wall thickness (AWT) can potentially improve our understanding of the
mechanism underlying atrial structure that drives AF and provides important
clinical information. However, most existing studies for estimating AWT rely on
ruler-based measurements performed on only a few selected locations in 2D or 3D
using digital calipers. Only a few studies have developed automatic approaches to
estimate the AWT in the left atrium, and there are currently no methods to
robustly estimate the AWT of both atrial chambers. Therefore, we have developed a
computational pipeline to automatically calculate the 3D AWT across bi-atrial
chambers and extensively validated our pipeline on both ex vivo and in vivo human
atria data. The atrial geometry was first obtained by segmenting the atrial wall 
from the MRIs using a novel machine learning approach. The epicardial and
endocardial surfaces were then separated using a multi-planar convex hull
approach to define boundary conditions, from which, a Laplace equation was solved
numerically to automatically separate bi-atrial chambers. To robustly estimate
the AWT in each atrial chamber, coupled partial differential equations by
coupling the Laplace solution with two surface trajectory functions were
formulated and solved. Our pipeline enabled the reconstruction and visualization 
of the 3D AWT for bi-atrial chambers with a relative error of 8% and outperformed
existing algorithms by >7%. Our approach can potentially lead to improved
clinical diagnosis, patient stratification, and clinical guidance during ablation
treatment for patients with AF.

individuals at high risk of developing COPD, but the trajectory of lung function 
decline varies greatly among individuals. This study involved the development and
validation of an individualized prediction model of lung function trajectory and 
risk of airflow limitation in the general population.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Framingham Offspring Cohort, which included 
4,167 participants ≥ 20 years of age and who had ≥ 2 valid spirometry
assessments. The primary outcome was prebronchodilator FEV1; the secondary
outcome was the risk of airflow limitation (defined as FEV1/FVC less than the
lower limit of normal). Mixed effects regression models were developed for
individualized prediction, and a machine learning algorithm was used to determine
essential predictors. The model was validated in two large, independent
multicenter cohorts (N = 2,075 and 12,913, respectively).
RESULTS: With 20 common predictors, the model explained 79% of the variation in
FEV1 decline in the derivation cohort. In two validation datasets, the model had 
low error in predicting FEV1 decline (root mean square error range, 0.18-0.22 L) 
and high discriminative power in predicting risk of airflow limitation
(C-statistic range, 0.86-0.87). This model was implemented in a freely accessible
website-based application, which allows prediction based on flexible sets of
predictors (http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/FraminghamFEV1).
CONCLUSIONS: The individualized predictor is an accurate tool to predict
long-term lung function trajectories and risk of airflow limitation in the
general population. This model enables identifying individuals at higher risk of 
COPD, who can then be targeted for preventive therapies.

blood flow and impaired autoregulation after TBI, which may lead to poor outcome.
Clinical evidence has implicated neurological injuries and associated
neuroinflammation as causes of cardiac dysfunction. Studies on newborn pigs show 
an association of elevated catecholamines with a sex-dependent impairment of
cerebral autoregulation after TBI. One strategy to decrease sympathetic
hyperactivity is pharmacological intervention with beta blockade. We tested the
hypothesis that propranolol would prevent the impairment of cerebral
autoregulation and tissue changes after TBI via inhibition of interleukin-6
(IL-6) upregulation.
METHODS: Using newborn pigs of both sexes equipped with a closed cranial window, 
TBI was induced via lateral fluid percussion injury. Propranolol was administered
at 1 h post-TBI. Analyses included cerebral autoregulation (pial artery
reactivity) before and 4 h post-TBI, CSF IL-6 analysed (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay), and histopathology at 4 h post-TBI.
RESULTS: Propranolol administration prevented impairment of hypotensive dilation 
in both male and female newborn pigs after fluid percussion injury, which was
paralleled by reduced upregulation of IL-6 in the CSF. Moreover, propranolol
prevented neuronal cell death in cornu amonis (CA)1 and CA3 hippocampus
equivalently in male and female pigs after TBI. Papaverine-induced dilation was
unchanged by TBI and propranolol.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that sympathetic hyperactivity noted after TBI
can be limited by propranolol administration to result in improved brain outcome 
post-injury via block of IL-6 upregulation, and this effect is irrespective of
sex.

reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have distinctive pathophysiologies, and thus,
therapeutic approaches to the 2 disorders should differ. Neurohormonal activation
drives the progression of HFrEF, and neurohormonal antagonists are highly
effective in HFrEF, but not in HFpEF. Conversely, a broad range of chronic
systemic inflammatory or metabolic disorders cause an expansion and inflammation 
of epicardial adipose tissue; the secretion of adipocytokines may lead to
microvascular dysfunction and fibrosis of the underlying myocardium, which (if
the left atrium is affected) may lead to atrial fibrillation (AF) and (if the
left ventricle is affected) may lead to HFpEF. Anti-inflammatory drugs (such as
statins and anticytokine agents) can ameliorate epicardial adipose tissue
dysfunction. Statins appear to ameliorate the development of atrial myopathy
(both experimentally and clinically), and in randomized controlled trials, they
reduce the incidence of new-onset and recurrent AF and decrease the risk of heart
failure with the features of HFpEF; yet, they have no benefits in HFrEF.
Similarly, anticytokine agents appear to prevent heart failure in patients with
or prone to HFpEF, but adversely affect HFrEF. Several antihyperglycemic agents
also reduce epicardial fat mass and inflammation, but this benefit may be offset 
by additional actions to cause sodium retention and neurohormonal activation.
Thiazolidinediones have favorable effects on experimental AF and HFpEF, but their
antinatriuretic actions negate these benefits, and they worsen the clinical
course of HFrEF. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also ameliorate AF and
HFpEF in laboratory models, but their positive inotropic and chronotropic effects
may be deleterious in HFrEF. By contrast, metformin and sodium-glucose
cotransporter 2 inhibitors alleviate epicardial adipose tissue dysfunction and
may reduce the risk of AF and HFpEF; yet, they may have additional actions to
promote cardiomyocyte survival that are useful in HFrEF. The concordance of the
benefits of anti-inflammatory and antihyperglycemic drugs on AF and HFpEF (but
not on HFrEF) supports the paradigm that epicardial adipose tissue is a central
pathogenetic mechanism and therapeutic target for both AF and HFpEF in patients
with chronic systemic inflammatory or metabolic diseases.

consisted of generating 20 000 different scenarios of a recipient either
receiving an IRD organ or waiting and receiving a non-IRD organ.
RESULTS: In the simulations, the 5-year survival probabilities of heart, liver,
and lung recipients who accepted IRD organ offers increased on average by 10.2%, 
12.7%, and 7.2%, respectively, compared with receiving a non-IRD organ after
average wait times (190, 228, and 223 days, respectively). When the estimated
waitlist time was at least 5 days for the liver, and 1 day for the heart and
lung, 50% or more of the simulations resulted in a higher chance of 5-year
survival when the patient received an IRD organ versus when the patient remained 
on the waitlist. We also developed a simple equation to estimate the benefits, in
terms of 5-year survival probabilities, of receiving an IRD organ versus waiting 
for a non-IRD organ, for a particular set of recipient/donor characteristics.
CONCLUSION: For all three organs, the majority of patients are predicted to have 
higher 5-year survival accepting an IRD organ offer compared with waiting for a
non-IRD organ.

requirement in the first week post-transplant; graft rejection was defined at
6 months and 1 year. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for recipient and
donor factors evaluated the effect of MP on DGF and graft rejection. Records for 
79 300 kidney transplants meeting inclusion criteria were abstracted, 42% of
which underwent MP. MP kidneys came from older donors, were more likely to have
been obtained following donation after cardiac death, and had longer cold
ischemic times. Rates of DGF and rejection were similar between MP and static
storage kidneys. Following adjustment, recipients of MP kidneys were less likely 
to experience rejection at 1 year (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.97] P = .002), but not 
at 6 months post-transplantation (OR 0.94 [0.88-1.02] P = .07). This effect
persisted following adjustment for cold ischemic time. This study adds to the
accumulating evidence demonstrating improved outcomes following MP of kidneys. We
encourage protocolized consideration of MP for kidney grafts.

intracellular molecule that binds Lck to elicit signals that result in cytokine
production in CD4+ T effector cells (Teff). Nevertheless, using Sh2d2a knockout
(KO; also called TSAd-/-) mice, we find that alloimmune CD4+ Teff responses are
fully competent in vivo. Furthermore, and contrary to expectations, we find that 
allograft rejection is accelerated in KO recipients of MHC class II-mismatched
B6.C-H-2bm12 heart transplants versus wild-type (WT) recipients. Also, KO
recipients of fully MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts are resistant to the
graft-prolonging effects of costimulatory blockade. Using adoptive transfer
models, we find that KO T regulatory cells (Tregs) are less efficient in
suppressing Teff function and they produce IFN-γ following mitogenic activation. 
In addition, pyrosequencing demonstrated higher levels of methylation of CpG
regions within the Treg-specific demethylated region of KO versus WT Tregs,
suggesting that TSAd, in part, promotes Treg stability. By Western blot, Lck is
absent in the mitochondria of KO Tregs, and reactive oxygen species production by
mitochondria is reduced in KO versus WT Tregs. Full transcriptomic analysis
demonstrated that the key mechanism of TSAd function in Tregs relates to its
effects on cellular activation rather than intrinsic effects on
mitochondria/metabolism. Nevertheless, KO Tregs compensate for a lack of
activation by increasing the number of mitochondria per cell. Thus, TSAd serves
as a critical cell-intrinsic molecule in CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs to regulate the
translocation of Lck to mitochondria, cellular activation responses, and the
development of immunoregulation following solid organ transplantation.

penalize occurring foldings inside the deformation field. RESULTS : Our approach 
succeeds at learning large deformations across multi-modal images. We evaluate
our approach on 100 pair-wise registrations of CT and MRI whole-heart scans and
demonstrate considerably higher Dice Scores (of 0.74) compared to a

better than state-of-the-art conventional registration methods. By using a volume

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor

diseases are still inadequate. Identification of additional components of the RAS
and associated vasoactive pathways, as well as new structural and functional
insights into established targets, have led to novel therapeutic approaches with 
the potential to provide improved cardiovascular protection and better blood
pressure control and/or reduced adverse side effects. The simultaneous modulation
of several neurohumoral mediators in key interconnected blood pressure-regulating
pathways has been an attractive approach to improve treatment efficacy, and
several novel approaches involve combination therapy or dual-acting agents. In
addition, increased understanding of the complexity of the RAS has led to novel
approaches aimed at upregulating the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas axis to
counter-regulate the harmful effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin
III/AT1R axis. These advances have opened new avenues for the development of
novel drugs targeting the RAS to better treat hypertension and heart failure.
Here we focus on new therapies in preclinical and early clinical stages of
development, including novel small molecule inhibitors and receptor
agonists/antagonists, less conventional strategies such as gene therapy to
suppress angiotensinogen at the RNA level, recombinant ACE2 protein, and novel
bispecific designer peptides.

An individualised approach supported by machine learning.,"Comment in
    Eur Respir J. 2019 Dec 12;54(6):.

BACKGROUND: The role of macrolide/β-lactam combination therapy in
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of moderate severity is a matter of debate.
Macrolides expand the coverage to atypical pathogens and attenuate pulmonary
inflammation, but have been associated with cardiovascular toxicity and drug
interactions. We developed a decision tree based on aetiological and clinical
parameters, which are available ex ante to support a personalised decision for or
against macrolides for the best clinical outcome of the individual patient.
METHODS: We employed machine learning in a cross-validation scheme based on a
well-balanced selection of 4898 patients after propensity score matching to data 
available on admission of 6440 hospitalised patients with moderate severity
(non-intensive care unit patients) from the observational, prospective,
multinational CAPNETZ study. We aimed to improve the primary outcome of 180-day
survival.
RESULTS: We found a simple decision tree of patient characteristics comprising
chronic cardiovascular and chronic respiratory comorbidities as well as leukocyte
counts in the respiratory secretion at enrolment. Specifically, we found that
patients without cardiovascular or patients with respiratory comorbidities and
high leukocyte counts in the respiratory secretion benefit from macrolide
treatment. Patients identified to be treated in compliance with our treatment
suggestion had a lower mortality of 27% (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.48-2.27; p<0.001)
compared to the observed standard of care.
CONCLUSION: Stratifying macrolide treatment in patients following a simple
treatment rule may lead to considerably reduced mortality in CAP. A future
randomised controlled trial confirming our result is necessary before
implementing this rule into the clinical routine.

morbidity and mortality worldwide despite intensive identification and treatment 
of traditional risk factors. Data emerging over the past decade show a quarter of
patients have disease in the absence of any known risk factor, and half have only
one risk factor. Improvements in quantification and characterisation of coronary 
atherosclerosis by CT coronary angiography (CTCA) can provide quantitative
measures of subclinical atherosclerosis-enhancing the power of unbiased 'omics'
studies to unravel the missing biology of personal susceptibility, identify new
biomarkers for early diagnosis and to suggest new targeted therapeutics.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: BioHEART-CT is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study,
aiming to recruit 5000 adult patients undergoing clinically indicated CTCA. After
informed consent, patient data, blood samples and CTCA imaging data are recorded.
Follow-up for all patients is conducted 1 month after recruitment, and then
annually for the life of the study. CTCA data provide volumetric quantification
of total calcified and non-calcified plaque, which will be assessed using
established and novel scoring systems. Comprehensive molecular phenotyping will
be performed using state-of-the-art genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and
immunophenotyping. Complex network and machine learning approaches will be
applied to biological and clinical datasets to identify novel pathophysiological 
pathways and to prioritise new biomarkers. Discovery analysis will be performed
in the first 1000 patients of BioHEART-CT, with validation analysis in the
following 4000 patients. Outcome data will be used to build improved risk models 
for CAD.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the human
research ethics committee of North Shore Local Health District in Sydney,
Australia. All findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals or at
scientific conferences.

worldwide. For improved accuracy of CVD prediction, risk classification was
performed using national time-series health examination data. The data offers an 
opportunity to access deep learning (RNN-LSTM), which is widely known as an
outstanding algorithm for analyzing time-series datasets. The objective of this
study was to show the improved accuracy of deep learning by comparing the
performance of a Cox hazard regression and RNN-LSTM based on survival analysis.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected 361,239 subjects (age 40 to 79 years) with more
than two health examination records from 2002-2006 using the National Health
Insurance System-National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS). The average
number of health screenings (from 2002-2013) used in the analysis was 2.9 ± 1.0. 
Two CVD prediction models were developed from the NHIS-HEALS data: a Cox hazard
regression model and a deep learning model. In an internal validation of the
NHIS-HEALS dataset, the Cox regression model showed a highest time-dependent area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87) for in females and 0.75 (95% 
CI 0.70 to 0.80) in males at 2 years. The deep learning model showed a highest
time-dependent AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) for in females and 0.96 (95% CI 
0.95 to 0.97) in males at 2 years. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
revealed that age was the variable that had the greatest effect on CVD, followed 
by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in that
order.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the deep learning model for predicting CVD
occurrences was better than that of the Cox regression model. In addition, it was
confirmed that the known risk factors shown to be important by previous clinical 
studies were extracted from the study results using LRP.",Captcha,NaN

affects 5-6 million people in endemic areas of the Americas. Presently,
chemotherapy relies on two compounds that were proposed as trypanocidal drugs
four decades ago: nifurtimox and benznidazole. Both drugs are able to eliminate
parasitemia and to avoid seroconversion in infected people when used in the acute
phase; however, their use in the chronic phase (the time when the majority of
cases are diagnosed) is limited due to their serious side effects. Memantine is a
glutamate receptor antagonist in the central nervous system of mammals that has
been used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our group previously reported
memantine as a trypanocidal drug that is able to induce apoptosis-like death in
T. cruzi. In the present work, we further investigated the effects of memantine
on the infection of RAW 264.7 macrophages and in vivo (in BALB/c mice). Here, we 
showed that memantine is able to diminish NO and Ca2+ entry in both LPS-activated
and non-activated cells. These results, together with the fact that memantine was
also able to reduce the infection of macrophages, led us to propose that this
drug is able to activate a pro-oxidant non-NO-dependent cell defense mechanism.
Finally, infected mice that were treated with memantine had diminished
parasitemia, cardiac parasitic load, and inflammatory infiltrates. In addition,
the treated mice had an increased survival rate. Taken together, these results
indicate memantine to be a candidate drug for the treatment of Chagas disease.",Captcha,NaN

other measures of cardiovascular risk. Since 1999, starting with neural network
methods, ML has been used to gauge the relationship between BP and pulse wave
forms. Since then, the scope of the research has expanded to using different
cardiometabolic risk factors like BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio in
concert with BP and its various pharmaceutical agents to estimate biochemical
measures (like HDL cholesterol, LDL and total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and uric
acid) as well as effectiveness of anti-hypertensive regimens. Data from large
clinical trials like the SPRINT are being re-analyzed by ML methods to unearth
new findings and identify unique relationships between predictors and outcomes.
In summary, AI and ML methods are gaining immense attention in the management of 
chronic disease. Elevated BP is a very important early metric for the risk of
development of cardiovascular and renal injury; therefore, advances in AI and ML 
will aid in early disease prediction and intervention.

Machine learning (ML) explores datasets to develop algorithms that do not assume 
linear relationships between variables and outcomes and that may account for
higher order interactions to make individualized outcome predictions. To evaluate
the performance of machine learning models compared to traditional risk
stratification methods for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that are
treated with antithrombotic therapy. Data on 24,178 ACS patients were pooled from
four randomized controlled trials. The super learner ensemble algorithm selected 
weights for 23 machine learning models and was compared to traditional models.
The efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial
infarction, or stroke. The safety endpoint was a composite of TIMI major and
minor bleeding or bleeding requiring medical attention. For the MACE outcome, the
super learner model produced a higher c-statistic (0.734) than logistic
regression (0.714), the TIMI risk score (0.489), and a new cardiovascular risk
score developed in the dataset (0.644). For the bleeding outcome, the super
learner demonstrated a similar c-statistic as the logistic regression model
(0.670 vs. 0.671). The machine learning risk estimates were highly calibrated
with observed efficacy and bleeding outcomes (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value = 0.692 and
0.970, respectively). The super learner algorithm was highly calibrated on both
efficacy and safety outcomes and produced the highest c-statistic for prediction 
of MACE compared to traditional risk stratification methods. This analysis
demonstrates a contemporary application of machine learning to guide
patient-level antithrombotic therapy treatment decisions.Clinical Trial

The immune response is orchestrated by a variety of immune cells. The function of
each cell is determined by the collective signals from various immunoreceptors,
whose expression and activity depend on the developmental stages of the cell and 
its environmental context. Recent studies have highlighted the presence of
mechanical force on several immunoreceptor-ligand pairs and the important role of
force in regulating their interaction and function. In this Perspective, we use
the T cell antigen receptor as an example with which to review the current
understanding of the mechanosensing properties of immunoreceptors. We discuss the
types of forces that immunoreceptors may encounter and the effects of force on
ligand bonding, conformational change and the triggering of immunoreceptors, as
well as the effects of force on the downstream signal transduction, cell-fate

suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Vascular endothelial dysfunction 
is a core pathophysiological event in the early stage of T2DM and eventually
leads to cardiovascular disease. Vaccarin (VAC), an active flavonoid glycoside
extracted from vaccariae semen, exhibits extensive biological activities
including vascular endothelial cell protection effects. However, little is known 
about whether VAC is involved in endothelial dysfunction regulation under high
glucose (HG) or hyperglycemia conditions. Here, in an in vivo study, we found
that VAC attenuated increased blood glucose, increased glucose and insulin
tolerance, relieved the disorder of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, and
improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in STZ/HFD-induced T2DM mice.
Furthermore, in cultured human microvascular endothelial cell-1 (HMEC-1) cells,
we showed that pretreatment with VAC dose-dependently increased nitric oxide (NO)
generation and the phosphorylation of eNOS under HG conditions. Mechanistically, 
VAC-treated HMEC-1 cells exhibited higher AMPK phosphorylation, which was
attenuated by HG stimulation. Moreover, HG-triggered miRNA-34a upregulation was
inhibited by VAC pretreatment, which is in accordance with pretreatment with AMPK
inhibitor compound C (CC). In addition, both reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and VAC abolished HG-evoked dephosphorylation
of AMPK and eNOS, increased miRNA-34a expression, and decreased NO production.
These results suggest that VAC impedes HG-induced endothelial dysfunction via
inhibition of the ROS/AMPK/miRNA-34a/eNOS signaling cascade.",Captcha,NaN

technology, office-based patient and provider communication is still the heart of
primary medical care. Patients typically present multiple complaints, requiring
physicians to decide how to balance competing demands. How this time is allocated
has implications for patient satisfaction, payments, and quality of care. We
investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for automated
annotation of medical topics in patient-provider dialog transcripts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to
predict talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to
operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers, support
vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential models that
integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional random fields,
hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent units).
RESULTS: Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1)
classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1 scores at
the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential models had higher
classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher precision at the visit 
level. Independent models had higher recall scores at the visit level compared
with sequential models.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the 
accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out noisy
information from talk-turns. Although the results are promising, more advanced
prediction techniques and larger labeled datasets will likely be required to
achieve prediction performance appropriate for real-world clinical applications.

consequent to non-resolving inflammation. Considerable evidence implicates
autophagy dysfunction at the core of this inflammatory condition, but the basis
of this dysfunction is not fully understood.
METHODS: Using an in vitro model of lipid-laden macrophages, activity-based
probes and high-throughput techniques, we studied the role of the cysteine
proteases cathepsins in autophagy.
RESULTS: We showed that cathepsin activity is suppressed by oxidized lipids and
that cathepsin has an indispensable role in the autophagy-lysosomal degradation
pathway. Accordingly, loss of cathepsin function resulted in autophagy
derangement. Shotgun proteomics confirmed autophagy dysfunction and unveiled a
pivotal role of cathepsin L in a putative cathepsin degradation network. At the
physiological level, cathepsin inhibition resulted in mitochondrial stress, which
translated into impaired oxidative metabolism, excessive production of reactive
oxygen species and activation of the cellular stress response, driven by
ATF4-CHOP transcription factors. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of these
cells uncovered some genetic similarities with the inflammatory macrophage
phenotype (a.k.a M1 macrophages) and increased expression of inflammatory
cytokines.
CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the importance of cathepsins for mitochondrial
quality control mechanisms and amelioration of vascular inflammation.

approach for valve-sparing correction of functional Type I aortic insufficiency
(AI) associated with aortic root aneurysms. In this study, short- and long-term
outcomes after the FL Sleeve procedure were investigated.
METHODS:  From May 2002 to January 2016, 177 patients underwent the FL Sleeve
procedure. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular
end-systolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, and degree of AI
(none = 0, minimal = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, severe = 4) were evaluated by
echocardiography.
RESULTS:  Mean ± standard deviation of age was 49.41 ± 15.37 years. Survival rate
was 98% at 1 year, 97% at 5 years, and 93% at 8 years. Freedom from reoperation
was 99% at 1 year and 98% at 2 to 8 years. Three patients (1.69%) died during
hospitalization. Three patients (1.69%) developed periprocedural stroke.
Postoperative follow-up echocardiography was available in 140 patients at 30
days, and 31 patients at 5 years. AI grade significantly improved from baseline
at 30 days (2.18 ± 1.26 vs. 1.1 ± 0.93, p < 0.001) and at 5 years (2.0 ± 1.23 vs.
1.45 ± 0.88, p = 0.04). Preoperative mean LVEDD significantly decreased from
52.20 ± 6.73 to 46.87 ± 8.40 (p < 0.001) at 30 days, and from 53.22 ± 7.07 to
46.61 ± 10.51 (p = 0.01) at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS:  The FL Sleeve procedure is a safe, effective, and durable treatment
of aortic root aneurysm and Type I AI. Long-term survival and freedom from
reoperation rates are encouraging.

a leading international journal that presents developments about computing
methods and their application in biomedical research. The journal published its
first issue in 1970. In 2020, the journal celebrates the 50th anniversary.
Motivated by this event, this article presents a bibliometric analysis of the
publications of the journal during this period (1970-2017).
METHODS: The objective is to identify the leading trends occurring in the journal
by analysing the most cited papers, keywords, authors, institutions and
countries. For doing so, the study uses the Web of Science Core Collection
database. Additionally, the work presents a graphical mapping of the
bibliographic information by using the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer
software. This is done to analyze bibliographic coupling, co-citation and
co-occurrence of keywords.
RESULTS: CMPB is identified as a leading and core journal for biomedical
researchers. The journal is strongly connected to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical
Engineering and IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. Paper from Wang, Jacques,
Zheng (published in 1995) is its most cited document. The top author in this
journal is James Geoffrey Chase and the top contributing institution is Uppsala U

Italy. China and Taiwan are the only Asian countries to appear in the top 10
publishing in CMPB. A keyword co-occurrences analysis revealed strong
co-occurrences for classification, picture archiving and communication system
(PACS), heart rate variability, survival analysis and simulation. Keywords
analysis for the last decade revealed that machine learning for a variety of
healthcare problems (including image processing and analysis) dominated other

digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present
study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of 
such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital
Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas
Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A
hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG
diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided
Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific
ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were
concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual
review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system 
using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were
identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients
<16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were
obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG
abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test
dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of 
atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of
cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in
women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a
large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of
digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.

characterization of cardiac structure and electrical activity. We hypothesized
that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and
availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical
inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving
interpretability for medical decision-making.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California,
San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of
cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into 
standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of
convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this
segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864
measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level
ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and
interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left
ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease
(pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid,
and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional
neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates,
with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6% for heart
rate and 4% for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles
enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral
annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16% and 19%, respectively) with
good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as
binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection
demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for
cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to
quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the
transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care.",Captcha,NaN

factor agents for treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), there are few
data on their ocular efficacy, the appropriate drug and dose, the need for
retreatment, and the possibility of long-term systemic effects. We evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with laser therapy in
treatment of ROP.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label, superiority multicentre, three-arm,
parallel group trial was done in 87 neonatal and ophthalmic centres in 26
countries. We screened infants with birthweight less than 1500 g who met criteria
for treatment for retinopathy, and randomised patients equally (1:1:1) to receive
a single bilateral intravitreal dose of ranibizumab 0·2 mg or ranibizumab 0·1 mg,
or laser therapy. Individuals were stratified by disease zone and geographical
region using computer interactive response technology. The primary outcome was
survival with no active retinopathy, no unfavourable structural outcomes, or need
for a different treatment modality at or before 24 weeks (two-sided α=0·05 for
superiority of ranibizumab 0·2 mg against laser therapy). Analysis was by
intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT02375971.
INTERPRETATION: Between Dec 31, 2015, and June 29, 2017, 225 participants
(ranibizumab 0·2 mg n=74, ranibizumab 0·1 mg n=77, laser therapy n=74) were
randomly assigned. Seven were withdrawn before treatment (n=1, n=1, n=5,
respectively) and 17 did not complete follow-up to 24 weeks, including four
deaths in each group. 214 infants were assessed for the primary outcome (n=70,
n=76, n=68, respectively). Treatment success occurred in 56 (80%) of 70 infants
receiving ranibizumab 0·2 mg compared with 57 (75%) of 76 infants receiving
ranibizumab 0·1 mg and 45 (66%) of 68 infants after laser therapy. Using a
hierarchical testing strategy, compared with laser therapy the odds ratio (OR) of
treatment success following ranibizumab 0·2 mg was 2·19 (95% Cl 0·99-4·82,
p=0·051), and following ranibizumab 0·1 mg was 1·57 (95% Cl 0·76-3·26); for
ranibizumab 0·2 mg compared with 0·1 mg the OR was 1·35 (95% Cl 0·61-2·98). One
infant had an unfavourable structural outcome following ranibizumab 0·2 mg,
compared with five following ranibizumab 0·1 mg and seven after laser therapy.
Death, serious and non-serious systemic adverse events, and ocular adverse events
were evenly distributed between the three groups.
FINDINGS: In the treatment of ROP, ranibizumab 0·2 mg might be superior to laser 
therapy, with fewer unfavourable ocular outcomes than laser therapy and with an
acceptable 24-week safety profile.

p53 tumour suppressor gene, is frequently amplified in malignancies. MDM2
antagonists have shown efficacy in treating malignancies with MDM2 overexpression
and can overcome chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We systematically
evaluated the safety profile of MDM2 inhibitors in the treatment of solid organ
and hematologic malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline and EMBASE from January 1947 to
November 2018 for prospective clinical studies, in English or French,
investigating any MDM2 inhibitor in pediatric or adult cancers, and reporting
dose and toxicity outcomes. Primary outcome was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and 
secondary outcome was death.
RESULTS: The search yielded 493 non-duplicate citations. Eighteen studies of 10
inhibitors met inclusion criteria (total N = 1005 patients). Two-thirds of
included studies did not define DLTs and the reporting of toxicities was highly
variable. The most commonly reported DLTs were cytopenias, gastrointestinal
toxicity, metabolic disturbances, fatigue and cardiovascular toxicity; there was 
one death attributed to treatment toxicity.
CONCLUSION: MDM2 antagonists have been studied in a variety of malignancies with 
toxicities similar to other commonly used chemotherapy agents and may represent a
safe adjuvant treatment for further study in in acute leukemia.

heart diseases. Accurate epicardial adipose tissue quantification is still an
open research issue. Considering that manual approaches are generally
user-dependent and time-consuming, computer-assisted tools can considerably
improve the result repeatability as well as reduce the time required for
performing an accurate segmentation. Unfortunately, fully automatic strategies
might not always identify the Region of Interest (ROI) correctly. Moreover, they 
could require user interaction for handling unexpected events. This paper
proposes a semi-automatic method for Epicardial Fat Volume (EFV) segmentation and
quantification. Unlike supervised Machine Learning approaches, the method does
not require any initial training or modeling phase to set up the system. As a
further key novelty, the method also yields a subdivision into quartiles of the
adipose tissue density. Quartile-based analysis conveys information about fat
densities distribution, enabling an in-depth study towards a possible correlation
between fat amounts, fat distribution, and heart diseases. Experimental tests
were performed on 50 Calcium Score (CaSc) series and 95 Coronary Computed
Tomography Angiography (CorCTA) series. Area-based and distance-based metrics
were used to evaluate the segmentation accuracy, by obtaining Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) = 93.74% and Mean Absolute Distance (MAD) = 2.18 for CaSc, as
well as DSC = 92.48% and MAD = 2.87 for CorCTA. Moreover, the Pearson and
Spearman coefficients were computed for quantifying the correlation between the
ground-truth EFV and the corresponding automated measurement, by obtaining 0.9591
and 0.9490 for CaSc, and 0.9513 and 0.9319 for CorCTA, respectively. In
conclusion, the proposed EFV quantification and analysis method represents a
clinically useable tool assisting the cardiologist to gain insights into a
specific clinical scenario and leading towards personalized diagnosis and
therapy.

the formation and stability of atherosclerotic plaque, as well as to explore the 
association between legumain with Smad3 pathway in a rat atherosclerosis model.
METHODS: Rat with thoracic aorta atherosclerosis was established and received
treatment with statin (n = 15 each) or controls (n = 10). Serum level of legumain
was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Legumain and Smad3 aortic
expression levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence
microscopy. Protein and mRNA levels were analyzed using Western blot analysis and
reverse transcriptase coupled polymerase chain reaction, respectively.
RESULTS: The atherosclerotic group showed higher serum legumain level than
control and statin group. Expression of legumain and Smad3 in macrophages and
foam cells was increased in atherosclerotic group compared to control and statin 
group. The protein and mRNA levels of legumain and Smad3 were significantly
attenuated by statin treatment (p < 0.05). For all groups, legumain expression
was correlated linearly with Smad3 at mRNA (coefficient: 0.94) and protein
(coefficient: 097) level.
CONCLUSIONS: Legumain and Smad3 expression is highly expressed in mainly
atherosclerotic plaque macrophages and linearly related, which is attenuated by
statin therapy, suggesting legumain a potential Smad3 pathway-related marker of
atherosclerosis.

diagnostic performance of machine-learning based coronary CT angiography
(cCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFRML) for the detection of
lesion-specific ischemia.
METHOD: Five centers enrolled 351 patients (73.5% male) with 525 vessels in the
MACHINE (Machine leArning Based CT angiograpHy derIved FFR: a Multi-ceNtEr)
registry. CT-FFRML and invasive FFR ≤ 0.80 were considered hemodynamically
significant, whereas cCTA luminal stenosis ≥50% was considered obstructive. The
diagnostic performance to assess lesion-specific ischemia in both men and women
was assessed on a per-vessel basis.
RESULTS: In total, 398 vessels in men and 127 vessels in women were included.
Compared to invasive FFR, CT-FFRML reached a sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive value of 78% (95%CI 72-84), 79% (95%CI 
73-84), 75% (95%CI 69-79), and 82% (95%CI: 76-86) in men vs. 75% (95%CI 58-88),
81 (95%CI 72-89), 61% (95%CI 50-72) and 89% (95%CI 82-94) in women, respectively.
CT-FFRML showed no statistically significant difference in the area under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) in men vs. women (AUC: 0.83 [95%CI 
0.79-0.87] vs. 0.83 [95%CI 0.75-0.89], p = 0.89). CT-FFRML was not superior to
cCTA alone [AUC: 0.83 (95%CI: 0.75-0.89) vs. 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65-0.81), p = 0.12]
in women, but showed a statistically significant improvement in men [0.83 (95%CI:
0.79-0.87) vs. 0.76 (95%CI: 0.71-0.80), p = 0.007].
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning based CT-FFR performs equally in men and women with
superior diagnostic performance over cCTA alone for the detection of
lesion-specific ischemia.

cardiovascular diseases. Studies have confirmed the anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, anti-bacterial and insecticidal, anti-tumor and neuro-protective
effects of DAP. However, its anti-arthritic potential remains unexplored. The aim
of this study is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo chondroprotective
effects of DAP.
MAIN METHODS: The effect of DAP on primary rabbit chondrocytes was examined using
recombinant human IL-1β for 24 h. For the in vivo studies, rabbits were randomly 
divided into groups: a normal control group and osteoarthritis (OA) groups. The
OA groups received three different doses of DAP for 4 or 8 weeks. The
anti-arthritic effect of DAP was assessed using histopathological examinations,
qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis.
KEY FINDINGS: Both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that DAP exerts a
protective effect against IL-1β in chondrocytes. In vitro, DAP inhibits the
expression of IL-6, IL-12, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13, induced by IL-1β in rabbit
chondrocytes, and stimulates the production of IL-10. The inhibitory effect of
DAP on the MMPs is partially regulated by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT, MAPK
and NF-κB signaling pathways. The effect of DAP on OA may be attributed to the
suppression of inflammatory factor secretion, chondrocyte apoptosis observed by
the decrease in pro-apoptotic Caspase-3 and BAX, and the activation of
anti-apoptotic BCL-2.
SIGNIFICANCE: DAP has a broad range of prospects in the treatment of OA, which
provides a novel therapeutic strategy for OA.

is associated with respiratory exacerbations in patients with COPD or cystic
fibrosis. We sought to determine whether similar findings were present in
patients with asthma and whether these findings were explained by differences in 
ventricular size.
METHODS: We measured the PA and aorta diameters in 233 individuals from the
Severe Asthma Research Program III cohort. We also estimated right, left, and
total epicardial cardiac ventricular volume indices (eERVVI, eELVVI, and eETVVI, 
respectively). Associations between the cardiac and PA measures (PA-to-aorta
[PA/A] ratio, eERVVI-to-eELVVI [eRV/eLV] ratio, eERVVI, eELVVI, eETVVI) and
clinical measures of asthma severity were assessed by Pearson correlation, and
associations with asthma severity and exacerbation rate were evaluated by
multivariable linear and zero-inflated negative binomial regression.
RESULTS: Asthma severity was associated with smaller ventricular volumes. For
example, those with severe asthma had 36.1 mL/m2 smaller eETVVI than healthy
control subjects (P = .003) and 14.1 mL/m2 smaller eETVVI than those with
mild/moderate disease (P = .011). Smaller ventricular volumes were also
associated with a higher rate of asthma exacerbations, both retrospectively and
prospectively. For example, those with an eETVVI less than the median had a
57% higher rate of exacerbations during follow-up than those with eETVVI greater 
than the median (P = .020). Neither PA/A nor eRV/eLV was associated with asthma
severity or exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with asthma, smaller cardiac ventricular size may be
associated with more severe disease and a higher rate of asthma exacerbations.

predict the risk of heart failure (HF) among patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from 8,756 patients free at baseline of
HF, with <10% missing data, and enrolled in the Action to Control Cardiovascular 
Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, we used random survival forest (RSF) methods, a 
nonparametric decision tree machine learning approach, to identify predictors of 
incident HF. The RSF model was externally validated in a cohort of individuals
with T2DM using the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent
Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 319 patients (3.6%) developed
incident HF. The RSF models demonstrated better discrimination than the best
performing Cox-based method (C-index 0.77 [95% CI 0.75-0.80] vs. 0.73 [0.70-0.76]
respectively) and had acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic χ2 =
9.63, P = 0.29) in the internal validation data set. From the identified
predictors, an integer-based risk score for 5-year HF incidence was created: the 
WATCH-DM (Weight [BMI], Age, hyperTension, Creatinine, HDL-C, Diabetes control
[fasting plasma glucose], QRS Duration, MI, and CABG) risk score. Each 1-unit
increment in the risk score was associated with a 24% higher relative risk of HF 
within 5 years. The cumulative 5-year incidence of HF increased in a graded
fashion from 1.1% in quintile 1 (WATCH-DM score ≤7) to 17.4% in quintile 5
(WATCH-DM score ≥14). In the external validation cohort, the RSF-based risk
prediction model and the WATCH-DM risk score performed well with good
discrimination (C-index = 0.74 and 0.70, respectively), acceptable calibration (P
≥0.20 for both), and broad risk stratification (5-year HF risk range from 2.5 to 
18.7% across quintiles 1-5).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel, machine learning-derived risk

complications were similar (CLOSE: 2.1% vs. AI: 2.5%; P = 0.87).
CONCLUSION: The CLOSE protocol is more effective than a PVI approach solely using
AI, especially in paroxysmal AF. In this off-AAD study, 79% of patients were free
from AF/AT during 12-month follow-up. The STSF catheter appears to be safe using 
conventional CLOSE targets.

contribute to fall risk classification or complement clinical assessment tools
such as the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC).
OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to (1) investigate the similarities and differences 
in physical activity (PA), heart rate, and night sleep in a sample of
community-dwelling older adults with varying fall histories using a smart
wrist-worn device and (2) create and evaluate fall risk classification models
based on (i) wearable data, (ii) the RAI-HC, and (iii) the combination of
wearable and RAI-HC data.
METHODS:  A prospective, observational study was conducted among 3 faller groups 
(G0, G1, G2+) based on the number of previous falls (0, 1, ≥2 falls) in a sample 
of older community-dwelling adults. Each participant was requested to wear a
smart wristband for 7 consecutive days while carrying out day-to-day activities
in their normal lives. The wearable and RAI-HC assessment data were analyzed and 
utilized to create fall risk classification models, with 3 supervised machine
learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest (RF).
RESULTS:  Of 40 participants aged 65 to 93 years, 16 (40%) had no previous falls,
whereas 8 (20%) and 16 (40%) had experienced 1 and multiple (≥2) falls,
respectively. Level of PA as measured by average daily steps was significantly
different between groups (P=.04). In the 3 faller group classification, RF
achieved the best accuracy of 83.8% using both wearable and RAI-HC data, which is
13.5% higher than that of using the RAI-HC data only and 18.9% higher than that
of using wearable data exclusively. In discriminating between {G0+G1} and G2+, RF
achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.894
(overall accuracy of 89.2%) based on wearable and RAI-HC data. Discrimination
between G0 and {G1+G2+} did not result in better classification performance than 
that between {G0+G1} and G2+.
CONCLUSIONS:  Both wearable data and the RAI-HC assessment can contribute to fall
risk classification. All the classification models revealed that RAI-HC
outperforms wearable data, and the best performance was achieved with the
combination of 2 datasets. Future studies in fall risk assessment should consider
using wearable technologies to supplement resident assessment instruments.

strokes in the general population. We aimed to identify whether hypertension or
other risk factors, including HIV-related factors, differ in their associations
with stroke subtypes in people living with HIV (PLWHIV).
Methods: HIV-1-positive individuals from the Data collection on Adverse events of
anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study were followed from the time of first blood pressure 
(BP) measurement after 1/1/1999 or study entry until the first of a validated
stroke, 6 months after last follow-up or 1/2/2014. Stroke events were centrally
validated using standardized criteria. Hypertension was defined as one systolic
BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg. Poisson and Cox proportional
hazards regression models determined associations of established
cerebro/cardiovascular disease and HIV-related risk factors with stroke and
tested whether these differed by stroke subtype.
Findings: 590 strokes (83 hemorrhagic, 296 ischemic, 211 unknown) occurred over
339,979 person-years (PYRS) (incidence rate/1000 PYRS 1.74 [95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.60-1.88]). Common predictors of both hemorrhagic and ischemic
strokes were hypertension (relative hazard 3.55 [95% CI 2.29-5.50] and 2.24
[1.77-2.84] respectively) and older age (1.28 [1.17-1.39] and 1.19 [1.12-1.25]). 
Male gender (1.62 [1.14-2.31] and 0.60 [0.35-0.91]), previous cardiovascular
events (4.03 [2.91-5.57] and 1.44 [0.66-3.16]) and smoking (1.90 [1.41-2.56] and 
1.08 [0.68-1.71]) were stronger predictors of ischemic then hemorrhagic strokes, 
whereas hypertension, hepatitis C (1.32 [0.72-2.40] and 0.46 [0.30-0.70]) and
estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.72 m3 (4.80 [2.47-9.36] and

interpretation of AF.
Methods: 24,123 consecutive 12-lead ECGs recorded over 6 months were interpreted 
by 1) the Veritas® algorithm, 2) physicians who overread Veritas®
(Veritas® + physician), and 3) Cardiologs® algorithm. We randomly selected 500

compared the algorithms' interpretations, and Veritas® + physician, with expert
interpretation. To assess sensitivity for AF, we analyzed a separate database of 
1473 randomly selected ECGs interpreted by both algorithms and by blinded
experts.
Results: Among the 500 ECGs selected, 399 had a final classification of AF; 101
(20.2%) had ≥1 false positive automated interpretation. Accuracy of Cardiologs®
(91.2%; CI: 82.4-94.4) was higher than Veritas® (80.2%; CI: 76.5-83.5)

plays a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Comprehensive lipidomic
analysis can provide new insights into the altered lipid metabolism in AD.
Method: In this study, a total 349 serum lipids were measured in 806 participants
enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 cohort and
analyzed using lipid-set enrichment statistics, a data mining method to find
coregulated lipid sets.
Results: We found that sets of blood lipids were associated with current AD
biomarkers and with AD clinical symptoms. AD diagnosis was associated with 7 of
28 lipid sets of which four also correlated with cognitive decline, including
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) correlated
with glucosylceramides, lysophosphatidylcholines and unsaturated
triacylglycerides; cerebrospinal fluid total tau and brain atrophy correlated
with monounsaturated sphingomyelins and ceramides, in addition to EPA-containing

Discussion: AD-associated lipid sets indicated that lipid desaturation,
elongation, and acyl chain remodeling processes are disturbed in AD subjects.

are rare. Therefore, we reviewed the long-term outcomes of subaortic membrane
resection in children with isolated DSS over 16 years from a single institution.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients (n =
27) who underwent resection of DSS between 2000 and 2017. Patients with major
concomitant intracardiac anomalies were excluded. Indications for surgery were
mean left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), Doppler gradient >30 mmHg, and/or
progressive aortic insufficiency.
Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 3.77 ± 3.49 years (range, 0.25-13 years)
and the mean age at surgery was 6.36 ± 3.69 years (range, 1-13 years). All
patients underwent resection of subaortic membrane. The mean LVOT Doppler
gradient decreased from 40.52 ± 11.41 mmHg preoperatively to 8.48 ± 5.06 mmHg
postoperatively (P < 0.001). The peak instantaneous LVOT Doppler gradient
decreased from 75.41 ± 15.22 mmHg preoperatively to 18.11 ± 11.44 mmHg
postoperatively (P < 0.001). At the latest follow-up, the peak gradient was 17.63
± 8.93 mmHg. The mean follow-up was 7.47 ± 3.53 years (median 6.33 years; range
2.67-16 years). There was no operative mortality or late mortality. Recurrence of
subaortic membrane occurred in 7 (25.92%, 7/27) patients who underwent primary
DSS operation. Four (14.81%, 4/27) patients required reoperation for DSS
recurrence at a median time of 4.8 years (3.1-9.1 years) after the initial
repair. Risk factors for reoperation were age <6 years at initial repair.
Eighteen (66.66%, 18/27) patients had AI preoperatively and progression of AI
occurred in 70.37% (19/27). This included 4 (22.22%, 4/18) patients who had
worsening of their preoperative AI. Short valve-to-membrane distance was found to
be prognostically unfavorable. One (3.7%, 1/27) patient had an iatrogenic
ventricular septal defect, and 2 (7.4%, 2/27) patients had complete AV block
following membrane resection.
Conclusions: Resection of subaortic membrane in children is associated with low
mortality. Higher LVOT gradient, younger age at initial repair, and shorter
valve-to-membrane distance were found to be associated with adverse outcome.
Recurrence and reoperation rates are high, and progression of aortic
insufficiency following subaortic membrane resection is common. Therefore, these 
patients warrant close follow-up into adult life.",Error: No result found on sci-hub.tw for 31516277,Nan

Methods: We reviewed the medical literature on the association of WRF during
acute decompensated heart failure with clinical outcomes. Results: WRF is
reported in approximately 25% to 40% of acute decompensated heart failure
patients. WRF is usually, but not always associated with worse outcomes in
patients with heart failure. Transient WRF accompanied with hemoconcentration,
effective decongestion strategies, and initiation of appropriate medical
treatment for heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists is not associated with worse outcomes.
Conclusions: Multiple mechanisms may contribute to WRF in acute decompensated
heart failure, and prognosis will differ according to etiology, patient features,
and treatment strategies. During hospitalization, treatment should focus on the
patient's clinical status, resolution of symptoms and signs of congestion rather 
than temporary changes in renal function.

respiration during sleep. Detection of the disease is achieved using a
polysomnography device, which is the gold standard in diagnosis. Diagnosis is
made by the steps of sleep staging and respiration scoring. Respiration scoring
is performed with at least four signals. Technical knowledge is required for
attaching the electrodes. Additionally, the electrodes are disturbing to an
extent that will delay the patient's sleep. It is needed to have systems as
alternatives for polysomnography devices that will bring a solution to these
issues. This study proposes a new approach for the process of respiration scoring
which is one of the diagnostic steps for the disease. A machine-learning-based
apnea detection algorithm was developed for the process of respiration scoring.
The study used Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
that is derived from this signal. The PPG records obtained from the patient and
control groups were cleaned out using a digital filter. Then, the HRV parameter
was derived from the PPG signal. Later, 46 features were derived from the PPG
signal and 40 features were derived from the HRV. The derived features were
classified with reduced machine-learning techniques using the F-score
feature-selection algorithm. The evaluation was made in a multifaceted manner.
Besides, Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce system input
(features). According to the results, if a real-time embedded system is designed,
the system can operate with 16 PPG feature 95%, four PPG feature 93.81% accuracy 
rate. These success rates are highly sufficient for the system to work.
Considering all these values, it is possible to realize a practical respiration

computer-assisted medical image analysis for the diagnosis of diseases such as
hypertension, diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy, and arteriosclerosis. Among 
the diseases, diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of vision
detachment, can be diagnosed early through the detection of retinal vessels. The 
manual detection of these retinal vessels is a time-consuming process that can be
automated with the help of artificial intelligence with deep learning. The
detection of vessels is difficult due to intensity variation and noise from
non-ideal imaging. Although there are deep learning approaches for vessel
segmentation, these methods require many trainable parameters, which increase the
network complexity. To address these issues, this paper presents a
dual-residual-stream-based vessel segmentation network (Vess-Net), which is not
as deep as conventional semantic segmentation networks, but provides good
segmentation with few trainable parameters and layers. The method takes advantage
of artificial intelligence for semantic segmentation to aid the diagnosis of
retinopathy. To evaluate the proposed Vess-Net method, experiments were conducted

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening disease and the third most frequent
cardiovascular cause of death after stroke and myocardial infarction. The annual 
incidence is increasing. The individual risk for PE-related complications and
death increases with the number of comorbidities and severity of right
ventricular dysfunction. Using clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters,
patients with PE can be stratified to four risk classes (high, intermediate-high,
intermediate-low and low risk). This risk stratification has concrete therapeutic
consequences ranging from out-of-hospital treatment of low-risk patients to
reperfusion treatment of (intermediate-) high-risk patients. For haemodynamically
unstable patients, a treatment decision should preferable be made in
interdisciplinary ""Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams"" (PERT). Being comparably
efficient and due to a preferable safety profile compared to vitamin-K
antagonists (VKAs), non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are
increasingly considered to be the treatment of choice for initial and prolonged
anticoagulation of patients with pulmonary embolism. The use of low molecular
weight heparins (LMWHs) is recommended for PE patients with cancer; however,
recent studies indicate that treatment with factor Xa-inhibitors may be effective
and safe (in patients without gastrointestinal cancer). Only prolonged
anticoagulation (in reduced dosage) will ensure reduction of VTE recurrence and
thus should be considered for all patients with unprovoked events.

lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced myocardial injury.
MAIN METHODS: H9c2 cells pretreated with or without DMF were stimulated with LPS.
Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were
detected using Western blotting. Mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial
superoxide production were observed using confocal microscope. Mitochondrial
respiration function was measured using Seahorse bioanalyzer.
KEY FINDINGS: (1) The cell viability decreased, LDH release and apoptosis
increased in LPS- challenged H9c2 cells. DMF pretreatment brought a higher cell
viability, and a lower LDH leakage and apoptosis than those of LPS group
(P < 0.01). (2) DMF pretreatment resulted in an increased Nrf2 and HO-1
expression, and enhanced nuclear Nrf2 level in LPS-challenged cells (P < 0.01).
(3) Nrf2-siRNA could inhibit DMF-induced enhancement of HO-1 expression and cell 
viability, and partly abolish DMF-induced reduction of LDH leakage and apoptosis.
(4) ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 could not only prevent the DMF-induced enhancement
of nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1, but also inhibit DMF-induced increase in cell
viability. (5) Compared with LPS-challenged cells, DMF pretreatment caused a
lower production of mitochondrial superoxide and a higher mitochondrial membrane 
potential, which could be abolished by Nrf2-siRNA. (6) DMF could attenuate
LPS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and improve mitochondrial respiration
function by enhancement of the oxygen consumption rate of basal respiration and
ATP production in LPS-challenged cells (P < 0.01).
SIGNIFICANCE: DMF protects cardiomyocytes against LPS-induced damage.
ERK1/2-dependent activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway is responsible for DMF-induced
cardioprotection via reduction of oxidative stress, improvement of mitochondrial 
morphology and energy metabolism.

the development of hypertension and vascular endothelial dysfunction has not been
defined. Here, we found that, compared with the wild-type (WT) Wistar rats,
miR-29b was robustly upregulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), while
CTRP6 was distinctly downregulated. There were two miRNA-responding-elements
(MREs) for miR-29 in the 3'-UTR of CTRP6 mRNA, and the luciferase activity assay 
revealed that miR-29b directly targeted CTRP6 mRNA. Intraventricular injection
was applied to deliver the miR-29b mimic or miR-29b inhibitor (4 mg/kg) into SHRs
once two weeks from 10th week. Downregulation of miR-29b could increase serum
CTRP6 content in SHRs, decrease the arterial systolic pressure, reduce serum
concentrations of Ang II and ET-1, and enhance serum NO content. Meanwhile, we
demonstrated that inhibition of miR-29b increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
to activate PPARγ, an inducer of Ang II. Finally, miR-29b expression was
manipulated in, and CTRP6 recombinant protein was applied to incubate with the
primary aortic endothelial cells. Inhibition of miR-29b increased CTRP6
expression, improved cell proliferation and migration, suppressed secretion of
Ang II and ET-1, and decreased ROS accumulation and LDH release, displaying a
similar effect to the CTRP6 recombinant protein. Moreover, the CTRP6 recombinant 
protein could antagonize the suppressive effect of miR-29b on activation of the
ERK/PPARγ axis and function of aortic endothelial cells. In conclusion, miR-29b
antagonism can alleviate Ang II-induced hypertension and vascular endothelial
dysfunction through activating the CTRP6/ERK/PPARγ axis.

accuracy. We sought to develop a machine learning (ML) model, utilizing clinical 
factors and the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), to predict the presence of 
obstructive CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study screened 35 281 participants enrolled in the
CONFIRM registry, who underwent ≥64 detector row CCTA evaluation because of
either suspected or previously established CAD. A boosted ensemble algorithm
(XGBoost) was used, with data split into a training set (80%) on which 10-fold
cross-validation was done and a test set (20%). Performance was assessed of the
(1) ML model (using 25 clinical and demographic features), (2) ML + CACS, (3) CAD
consortium clinical score, (4) CAD consortium clinical score + CACS, and (5)
updated Diamond-Forrester (UDF) score. The study population comprised of 13 054
patients, of whom 2380 (18.2%) had obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis). Machine
learning with CACS produced the best performance [area under the curve (AUC) of
0.881] compared with ML alone (AUC of 0.773), CAD consortium clinical score (AUC 
of 0.734), and with CACS (AUC of 0.866) and UDF (AUC of 0.682), P < 0.05 for all 
comparisons. CACS, age, and gender were the highest ranking features.
CONCLUSION: A ML model incorporating clinical features in addition to CACS can
accurately estimate the pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD on CCTA. In
clinical practice, the utilization of such an approach could improve risk
stratification and help guide downstream management.

skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Major treatment modalities for diabetes
include the drugs from the class of sulfonyl urea, Insulin, GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2
inhibitors, DPP-IV inhibitors and Thiazolidinediones. Emerging antidiabetic
therapeutics also include classes of drugs targeting GPCRs in the liver, adipose 
tissue and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, recent research highlights several
shared intermediates between insulin and GPCR signaling cascades opening
potential novel avenues for diabetic drug discovery.

on the body itself but also, surprisingly, on cognition: specifically, physical
high-intensity intermittent aerobic exercise (HIE) can show improvement on
cognitive executive functions. Although, in some cases performing strength or
aerobic training is problematic or not feasible. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) 
can induce the illusory feeling of ownership and agency over a moving virtual
body, therefore showing comparable physiological reactions: for example, if an
individual is sitting on a chair but his virtual body climbs a hill, the
individual's heart rate increases coherently, as if he is actually walking. In
this study, we investigate whether this same illusion can show beneficial
consequences on the body as well as on executive functions (using the color-word 
matching Stroop task) and on its neural substrates (using functional
near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS]).
METHODS: In a cross-over randomized controlled trial, 30 healthy young adults
will experience HIE training in IVR (i.e. the virtual body will perform eight
sets of 30 s of running followed by 30 s of slow walking, while the participant
is completely still) according to two random-ordered conditions: during the
experimental condition, the virtual body is displayed in first-person perspective
(1PP), while in the control condition, the virtual body is displayed in
third-person perspective (3PP). To confirm that individuals have the illusion of 
ownership and agency over the virtual body in 1PP (and not in 3PP), we will
record the heart rate, in addition to subjective questionnaires. Before and after
every IVR sessions (one week apart), we will measure cortical hemodynamic changes
in the participants' prefrontal cortex using the fNIRS device during the Stroop
task's execution.
DISCUSSION: From a theoretical perspective, we could prove that the sense of body
ownership and agency can modulate physical and cognitive parameters, even in the 
absence of actual movements; from a clinical perspective, these results could be 
useful to train cognition and body simultaneously, in a completely safe
environment.

homeostasis by strictly controlling the passage of molecules and solutes from the
bloodstream into the CNS. Complex and continuous tight junctions (TJs) between
brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules
across the BBB, with claudin-5 being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin-5
deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the
contribution of other claudins or tight-junction associated proteins in
establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has
been reported, however the exact function and subcellular localization of this
atypical claudin remains unknown.
METHODS: We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression 
of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs function during health and
neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic
check-up of the mouse mutant.
RESULTS: Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be
broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was
detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium.
Claudin-12lacZ/lacZ C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an
intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated
neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the
precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that
available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining
patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12lacZ/lacZ C57BL/6J mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in
establishing or maintaining BBB TJs integrity. Claudin-12 is rather expressed in 
cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than 
forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of
clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12lacZ/lacZ C57BL/6J mice
suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more
prominently, in cardiovascular functions.",Captcha,NaN

due to environmental and other nonphotic synchronizers. The main purpose of this 
article is to establish whether critically patients have desynchronization at the
molecular level after 1 week of stay in the ICU.
METHODS: The rhythm of Clock, Bmal1, Cry1, and Per2 genes in neuro-ICU patients
(n = 11) on the first day after admission in the unit (1 day) and 1 week later (1
week) was studied, 4 time points throughout the day, at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. 
Human whole blood samples were obtained from neuro-ICU patients. The total RNA
was isolated and each sample was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCRq) was performed. The possible rhythm 
was studied using Fourier Series.
RESULTS: After 1 week, the clock gene rhythmicity completely disappeared.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for the 4 clock genes was shown rhythmicity at
the first day after admission in the ICU. Circadian rhythmicity for none of them 
was observed but rather, ultradian rhythmicity was found. The expression of
Clock, Bmal1, and Per2 mRNA after 1 week was similar in the 4-time point studies 
without significant fluctuation among the 4 time points analyzed.
DISCUSSION: Rhythmic mRNA expression is present at the first day after admission 
in the ICU. However, ICU stay during 1 week affects the molecular machinery of
the biological clock generating chronodisruption. Circadian disruption is
associated with the risk of several pathologies, thus, it seems to be clear that 
ICU stay in constant conditions could adversely affect patient evolution and
probably, circadian resynchronization restoring clock gene expression could lead 
to a better clinical evolution of the patient.

therapy as well as melatonin treatment could reduce the impact of ICU stay period

treatment approaches for hypertension in general, and resistant hypertension (RH)

RECENT FINDINGS: RH is defined as blood pressure (BP) that remains above target
levels despite adherence to at least three antihypertensive medications,
including a diuretic. Thus far, clinical trials of pharmacological approaches in 
RH have focused on older molecules, with spironolactone being demonstrated as the
most efficacious fourth-line agent. However, the use of spironolactone in
clinical practice is hampered by its side effect profile and the risk of
hyperkalaemia in important RH subgroups, such as patients with moderate-severe
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical trials of new molecules targeting both
well-established and more recently elucidated pathophysiologic mechanisms of
hypertension offer a multitude of potential treatment avenues that warrant
further evaluation in the context of RH. These include selective
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), aldosterone synthase inhibitors
(ASIs), activators of the counterregulatory renin-angiotensin-system (RAS),
vaccines, neprilysin inhibitors alone and in combined formulations, natriuretic
peptide receptor agonists A (NPRA-A) agonists, vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP) agonists, centrally acting aminopeptidase A (APA|) inhibitors,
antimicrobial suppression of central sympathetic outflow (minocycline), dopamine 
β-hydroxylase (DβH) inhibitors and Na+/H+ Exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitors. There is
a paucity of data from trials evaluating newer molecules for the treatment of RH.
Emergent novel molecules for non-resistant forms of hypertension heighten the
prospects of identifying new, effective and well-tolerated pharmacological

periods of hemodynamic instability. We aimed to create novel SV estimating model 
based on deep-learning (DL) method. A convolutional neural network was applied to
estimate SV from arterial blood pressure waveform data recorded from liver
transplantation (LT) surgeries. The model was trained using a gold standard
referential SV measured via pulmonary artery thermodilution method. Merging a
gold standard SV and corresponding 10.24 seconds of arterial blood pressure
waveform as an input/output data set with 2-senconds of sliding overlap, 484,384

The performance of DL model was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses
in another 491,353 data sets from 31 LT surgeries. We also evaluated the
performance of pre-existing commercialized model (EV1000), and the performance
results of DL model and EV1000 were compared. The DL model provided an acceptable
performance throughout the surgery (r = 0.813, concordance rate = 74.15%). During

    Nat Rev Cardiol. 2019 Nov;16(11):646-647.

BACKGROUND: Coronary inflammation induces dynamic changes in the balance between 
water and lipid content in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), as captured by
perivascular Fat Attenuation Index (FAI) in standard coronary CT angiography
(CCTA). However, inflammation is not the only process involved in atherogenesis
and we hypothesized that additional radiomic signatures of adverse fibrotic and
microvascular PVAT remodelling, may further improve cardiac risk prediction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a new artificial intelligence-powered method to
predict cardiac risk by analysing the radiomic profile of coronary PVAT,
developed and validated in patient cohorts acquired in three different studies.
In Study 1, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 167 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery, and the expression of genes representing inflammation, fibrosis 
and vascularity was linked with the radiomic features extracted from tissue CT
images. Adipose tissue wavelet-transformed mean attenuation (captured by FAI) was
the most sensitive radiomic feature in describing tissue inflammation (TNFA
expression), while features of radiomic texture were related to adipose tissue
fibrosis (COL1A1 expression) and vascularity (CD31 expression). In Study 2, we
analysed 1391 coronary PVAT radiomic features in 101 patients who experienced
major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 5 years of having a CCTA and 101
matched controls, training and validating a machine learning (random forest)
algorithm (fat radiomic profile, FRP) to discriminate cases from controls
(C-statistic 0.77 [95%CI: 0.62-0.93] in the external validation set). The
coronary FRP signature was then tested in 1575 consecutive eligible participants 
in the SCOT-HEART trial, where it significantly improved MACE prediction beyond
traditional risk stratification that included risk factors, coronary calcium
score, coronary stenosis, and high-risk plaque features on CCTA (Δ[C-statistic] =
0.126, P < 0.001). In Study 3, FRP was significantly higher in 44 patients
presenting with acute myocardial infarction compared with 44 matched controls,
but unlike FAI, remained unchanged 6 months after the index event, confirming
that FRP detects persistent PVAT changes not captured by FAI.
CONCLUSION: The CCTA-based radiomic profiling of coronary artery PVAT detects
perivascular structural remodelling associated with coronary artery disease,
beyond inflammation. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging biomarker
(FRP) leads to a striking improvement of cardiac risk prediction over and above
the current state-of-the-art.

differently in men versus women.
METHODS: We examined CVD mortality rates between 2007 and 2017 among all
HIV-positive New York City residents age 13+ by sex, using data from city HIV
surveillance and vital statistics and the National Death Index. Residents without
HIV were enumerated using modified US intercensal estimates. We determined
associations of HIV status with CVD mortality by sex after accounting for age,
race/ethnicity, year, and neighborhood poverty, defined as the percent living
below the federal poverty level.
RESULTS: There were 3,234 CVD deaths reported among 147,915 HIV-positive New
Yorkers, with the proportion of deaths due to CVD increasing from 11% in 2007 to 
22% in 2017. The age-standardized CVD mortality rate was 2.7/1,000 person-years
among both men and women with HIV. The relative rate of CVD mortality associated 
with HIV status was significantly higher among women (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]
1.7, 95% CI 1.6-1.8) than men (aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3) overall, and within
strata defined by neighborhood poverty. Sex differences in CVD mortality rates
were the greatest comparing HIV-positive individuals having detectable HIV RNA
and CD4+ T-cell counts <500 cells/uL with HIV-negative individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: One in five deaths among people with HIV is now associated with CVD.
HIV providers should recognize CVD risk among women with HIV, and reinforce
preventive measures (e.g., smoking cessation, blood pressure control, lipid
management) and viremic control among all people living with HIV to reduce CVD
mortality.

increased from 42.4% to 69.9% after the introduction of the new guideline. Stent 
thrombosis occurred in 1.3% (26/1947) pre-guideline and 0.6% (7/1244)
post-guideline (P = .037). Of the 33 stent thrombosis cases, 90% (27/30) had
received morphine, of whom 85.2% (23/27) had not received adjunctive GPI.
Complete records for assessing 30-day bleeding rates were only available in 374
patients and, in this subset, there was no significant difference in rates of
GUSTO moderate or severe bleeding before vs. after introduction of the local
guideline (1.7% vs 2.8%; P = .47) although, in both cohorts combined, any GUSTO
bleeding was observed more frequently in GPI-treated patients (21.8%) compared to
those not receiving a GPI (10.0%; P = .002). In conclusion, routine GPI use in
morphine-treated STEMI patients undergoing PPCI appears to protect against stent 
thrombosis. Large-scale studies are needed to establish the overall risk-benefit 
of GPI therapy in morphine-treated PPCI patients and to assess alternative
strategies for preventing acute stent thrombosis in these patients.",Captcha,NaN

pulmonary vein isolation, but not for linear ablation of the cavotricuspid
isthmus (CTI) for typical right atrial flutter (AFL). We thus studied the
feasibility and effectiveness of AI-guided CTI for AFL.
METHODS: Procedural and 6-month outcomes of ablation for AFL were retrospectively
compared between consecutive patients undergoing either AI-guided ablation of CTI
(n = 43; AI target of 500 for anterior 2/3 segments and 400 for posterior 1/3
segments) or contact force (CF)-guided ablation (n = 42) at a single center. Each
Visitag dataset from all patients in each group was analyzed.
RESULTS: AI guidance vs CF guidance was associated with: higher first-pass
conduction block of CTI (93.0% vs 76.2%, P = .03) with similar ablation time;
similar acute spontaneous CTI reconnection 2.3% vs 9.5%, P = .343); fewer
radiofrequency (RF) applications (10.1 ± 2.8 vs 11.5 ± 3.0, P = .031) needed to
achieve CTI directional block; significantly higher mean ablation time, impedance
drop, force time integral and AI and similar mean CF and power of each VisiTag
point. One inguinal hematoma and one pseudoaneurysm developed in the AI and CF
groups, respectively. Recurrent AFL was recorded in two (4.7%) AI-group patients 
and four (9.5%) CF-group patients (P = .650).
CONCLUSION: AI-guided ablation of CTI line for AFL appears feasible and effective
with similar ablation time, fewer RF applications, a higher rate of first-pass
conduction block, and no additional complications.

glutathione, which plays an important role in redox regulation. We have
previously shown that Gsr facilitates neutrophil bactericidal activities and is
pivotal for host defense against bacterial pathogens. However, it is unclear
whether Gsr is required for immune defense against fungal pathogens. It is also
unclear whether Gsr plays a role in immunological functions outside of
neutrophils during immune defense. In this study, we report that Gsr-/- mice
exhibited markedly increased susceptibility to Candida albicans challenge. Upon
C. albicans infection, Gsr-/- mice exhibited dramatically increased fungal burden
in the kidneys, cytokine and chemokine storm, striking neutrophil infiltration,
histological abnormalities in both the kidneys and heart, and substantially
elevated mortality. Large fungal foci surrounded by massive numbers of
neutrophils were detected outside of the glomeruli in the kidneys of Gsr -/- mice
but were not found in wild-type mice. Examination of the neutrophils and
macrophages of Gsr-/- mice revealed several defects. Gsr -/- neutrophils
exhibited compromised phagocytosis, attenuated respiratory burst, and impaired
fungicidal activity in vitro. Moreover, upon C. albicans stimulation, Gsr -/-
macrophages produced increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and exhibited
elevated p38 and JNK activities, at least in part, because of lower MAPK
phosphatase (Mkp)-1 activity and greater Syk activity. Thus, Gsr-mediated redox
regulation is crucial for fungal clearance by neutrophils and the proper control 
of the inflammatory response by macrophages during host defense against fungal
challenge.

trials. Inconsistent image analysis introduces variability, hinders
differentiation of diseases, and results in larger sample sizes. We present a
systematic approach to standardize T1-map analysis by human operators to improve 
accuracy and consistency.
METHODS: We developed a multi-step training program for T1-map post-processing.
The training dataset contained 42 left ventricular (LV) short-axis T1-maps
(normal and diseases; 1.5 and 3 Tesla). Contours drawn by two experienced human
operators served as reference for myocardial T1 and wall thickness (WT). Trainees
(n = 26) underwent training and were evaluated by: (a) qualitative review of
contours; (b) quantitative comparison with reference T1 and WT.
RESULTS: The mean absolute difference between reference operators was
8.4 ± 6.3 ms (T1) and 1.2 ± 0.7 pixels (WT). Trainees' mean discrepancy from
reference in T1 improved significantly post-training (from 8.1 ± 2.4 to
6.7 ± 1.4 ms; p < 0.001), with a 43% reduction in standard deviation (SD)
(p = 0.035). WT also improved significantly post-training (from 0.9 ± 0.4 to
0.7 ± 0.2 pixels, p = 0.036), with 47% reduction in SD (p = 0.04). These
experimentally-derived thresholds served to guide the training process: T1
(±8 ms) and WT (±1 pixel) from reference.
CONCLUSION: A standardized approach to CMR T1-map image post-processing leads to 
significant improvements in the accuracy and consistency of LV myocardial T1
values and wall thickness. Improving consistency between operators can translate 
into 33-72% reduction in clinical trial sample-sizes. This work may: (a) serve as
a basis for re-certification for core-lab operators; (b) translate to sample-size
reductions for clinical studies; (c) produce better-quality training datasets for
machine learning.

may lead to future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity is also related to
increased inflammation and a low testosterone level. This study was conducted to 
determine the relationship between inflammation, testosterone level, and vascular
function among subjects with an increased body mass index (BMI) and to determine 
whether both low testosterone and high inflammation have synergistic effects
towards vascular dysfunction. Materials and Methods: A total of 303 men aged
40-80 years were recruited from Klang Valley, Malaysia. Their height, weight,
blood pressure (BP), lipid, blood glucose level, total testosterone (TT), free
testosterone (FT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. The carotid
femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVCF) and augmentation index (AI) were also
recorded as markers of vascular function. Results: The mean age of all the
subjects was 54.46 ± 9.77 years. Subjects were divided into a low/normal body
mass index (BMI) group (BMI < 25 kg/m2; NG, n = 154) and high BMI group (BMI ≥ 25
kg/m2; OG, n = 149). The mean BMI for NG was 22.20 ± 1.94 kg/m2 while for OG was 
28.87 ± 3.24 kg/m2 (p < 0.01). The level of TT (OG = 21.13 ± 6.44 versus NG =

nmol/L, p < 0.01) were reduced while the level of CRP [OG = 1.05 (2.80) versus NG
= 0.50 (1.50) mmol/L, p = 0.01] was increased in OG compared to NG. PWVCF (OG =

adjustment for other CVD risk factors. The subjects that had both a low FT and an
increased CRP had higher AI when compared to those with a high CRP and high FT (p
< 0.01). Conclusions: The increased BMI was associated with vascular dysfunction,
mediated by a low testosterone level and increased inflammation. Furthermore,
having both conditions concurrently lead to higher vascular dysfunction. Weight

of mast cells have been described based on the analysis of transcriptomes of
anatomically distinct mouse mast cell populations. Although mast cells can
potently alter homeostasis, in certain circumstances, these cells can also
contribute to the restoration of homeostasis. Both solid and hematologic tumors

mast cell mediators derived from otherwise similar cells, could play distinct or

cells can participate both in physiological and pathological processes in the

detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The 
increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization 
in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis
detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and
their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is 
required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching
methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 
5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current
developments in this area of research.
OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of
clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and
septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the
preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic
bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus,
and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers
based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated
search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles
and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined
categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification 
was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including
patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system
such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or
data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including
ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed 
qualitatively by two reviewers.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were
identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies.
More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report
the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective,
which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of
upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as
sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
The most common combinations of categories ""algorithm used"" and ""support type""
are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In 
evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the
most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size
between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only
five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them 
using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations 
of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system
interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in
routine settings are missing in nearly all articles.
CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context
successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven
algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric 
population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening
condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations
for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are
often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest
will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating
SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable
in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives.

pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Altered DNA
methylation is one such epigenetic factor that could lead to altered disease
etiology. In this study, we comprehensively identified methylation sites in
several genes that have been previously associated with young CAD patients.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 42 healthy controls and 33 young CAD
patients (age group <50 years). We performed targeted bisulfite sequencing of
promoter as well as gene body regions of several genes in various pathways like
cholesterol synthesis and metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, apoptosis, which
are implicated in the development of CAD.
RESULTS: We observed that the genes like GALNT2, HMGCR were hypermethylated in
the promoter whereas LDLR gene promoter was hypomethylated indicating that
intracellular LDL uptake was higher in CAD patients. Although APOA1 did not show 
significant change in methylation but APOC3 and APOA5 showed variation in
methylation in promoter and exonic regions. Glucokinase (GCK) and endothelial
nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) were hyper methylated in the promoter. Genes
involved in apoptosis (BAX/BCL2/AKT2) and inflammation (PHACTR1/LCK) also showed 
differential methylation between controls and CAD patients. A combined analysis
of the methylated CpG sites using machine learning tool revealed 14 CpGs in 11
genes that could discriminate CAD cases from controls with over 93% accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique because it highlights important gene
methylation alterations which might predict the risk of young CAD in Indian
population. Large scale studies in different populations would be important for
validating our findings and understanding the epigenetic events associated with
CAD.

for treating patients with acute HF and in-hospital mortality. Methods and
Results This was a cross-sectional study, and we used the Japanese Registry of
All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases Diagnosis Procedure Combination discharge
database. The data of patients with HF on emergency admission from April 1, 2012,
to March 31, 2014, were extracted. The patients were categorized into 4 groups by

13-acetate and cyclosporin A (CsA) in both ex-vivo and in-vivo

sensitive chloride channels in mediating cardio-protection upon IR injury.
Although IAA-94 sensitive chloride currents are recorded in cardiac mitoplast,
there is still a lack of understanding of the mechanism by which IAA-94 increases
myocardial infarction (MI) by IR injury. Mitochondria are the key arbitrators of 
cell life and death pathways. Both oxidative stress and calcium overload in the
mitochondria, elicit pathways resulting in the opening of mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (mPTP) leading to cell death. Therefore, in this
study we explored the role of IAA-94 in MI and in maintaining calcium retention
capacity (CRC) of cardiac mitochondria after IR. IAA-94 inhibited the CRC of the 
isolated cardiac mitochondria in a concentration-dependent manner as measured
spectrofluorimetrically using calcium green-5 N. Interestingly, IAA-94 did not
change the mitochondrial membrane potential. Further, CsA a blocker of mPTP
opening could not override the effect of IAA-94. We also showed for the first
time that IAA-94 perfusion after ischemic event augments MI by reducing the CRC
of mitochondria. To conclude, our results demonstrate that the mechanism of
IAA-94 mediated cardio-deleterious effects is via modulating the mitochondria
CRC, thereby playing a role in mPTP opening. These findings highlight new
pharmacological targets, which can mediate cardioprotection from IR injury.

the expression of MO25, LKB1, pAMPKa, ATG13, p62 and LC3BI/II was noticeably
increased by antagomiR-429. In conclusion, our results suggested that antagonism 
of miR-429 ameliorates anoxia/reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes by enhancing
MO25/LKB1/AMPK mediated autophagy.

calcifications (BAC) assessment for an effective stratification of cardiovascular
(CV) risk in women, for whom current preventive strategies are inadequate. BAC,
easily detectable on mammograms, are associated with CV disease and represent a
potential imaging biomarker for CV disease prevention in women.
METHOD: We summarized the available evidence on this topic.
RESULTS: Age, parity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were found to positively
correlate with BAC. Women with BAC have a higher CV risk than those without BAC: 
the relative risk was reported to be 1.4 for transient ischemic attack/stroke,
1.5 for thrombosis, 1.8 for myocardial infarction; the reported hazard ratio was 
1.32 for coronary artery disease (CAD), 1.52 for heart failure, 1.29 for CV
death, 1.44 for death from CAD. However, BAC do not alarm radiologists; when
reported, they are commonly mentioned as ""present"", not impacting on CV
decision-making. Of 18 published studies, 9 reported only presence/absence of
BAC, 4 used a semi-quantitative scale, and 5 a continuous scale (with manual,
automatic or semiautomatic segmentation). Various appearance, topological
complexity, and vessels overlap make BAC quantification difficult to standardize.
Nevertheless, machine learning approaches showed promising results in BAC
quantification on mammograms.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong rationale for mammography to become a dual test
for breast cancer screening and CV disease prevention. However, robust and
automated quantification methods are needed for a deeper insight on the
association between BAC and CV disease, to stratifying CV risk and define
personalized preventive actions.

atrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility in rats.
MAIN METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned into three groups for intraperitoneal
treatment with saline (CTL group), BD1047 (an antagonist of the S1R, BD group) or
BD1047 plus fluvoxamine (an agonist of the S1R, BD + F group) for 4 weeks. The
heart rate variability (HRV) and atrial electrophysiological parameters were
measured via the PowerLab system and analyzed by LabChart 8.0 software. Atrial
histology was determined with Masson staining. The protein levels of connexin
(Cx) 40, Cav1.2, S1R, eNOS, p-eNOS, and p-AKT were detected by western blot
assays.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that BD1047 significantly shortened the atrial
effective refractory period (ERP) and action potential duration (APD), increased 
AF inducibility and duration, augmented sympathetic activity, depressed
parasympathetic activity, and reduced heart rate variability (HRV) compared with 
the CTL group. Masson staining also showed a significant increase in atrial
fibrosis in the BD group. Furthermore, the expressions of S1R, Cx40, Cav1.2,
p-eNOS, and p-AKT were dramatically reduced in the BD group compared with the CTL
group (all P < 0.01). However, fluvoxamine administration mitigated most of the
abovementioned alterations.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicated that S1R inhibition contributed to atrial
electrical remodeling, cardiac autonomic remodeling and atrial fibrosis, which
could be attenuated by fluvoxamine, thus providing new insights into the
relationship between the S1R and AF.

contributes to the pathology of age-related diseases. Monocytes are innate immune
cells that become dysregulated with age and which can contribute to inflammaging.
Metabolism plays a key role in determining immune cell functions, with
anti-inflammatory cells primarily relying on fatty acid oxidation and
pro-inflammatory cells primarily relying on glycolysis. It was recently shown
that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes can compensate for a lack of
glucose by utilizing fatty acid oxidation. Given that mitochondrial function
decreases with age, we hypothesized that classical monocytes taken from aged
individuals would have an impaired ability to upregulate oxidative metabolism
along with impaired effector functions. Aging did not impair LPS-induced oxygen
consumption rate during glucose deprivation as measured on a Seahorse XFp system.
Additionally, aged classical monocytes maintained inflammatory gene expression
responses and phagocytic capacity during LPS stimulation in the absence of
glucose. In conclusion, aged classical monocytes maintain effector and metabolic 
functions during glucose deprivation, at least in an ex vivo context.

blockers (ACEis/ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been
shown to benefit patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF). However, there is a lack of information on the advantages of these drugs
for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this gap is especially
pronounced in elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the role of treatment
consisting of ACEi/ARBs and MRAs in patients ≥ 75 years of age with CKD.
METHODS: From January 2008 to July 2014, 390 consecutive patients ≥ 75 years of
age with an ejection fraction ≤ 35% and a glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included. We analyzed the relationship between
treatment with ACEi/ARBs and MRAs and mortality or cardiovascular events.
RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety patients were included, with a mean age of
82.6 ± 4.1 years. Mean ejection fraction was 27.9 ± 6.5%. Renal dysfunction was
mild (GFR 45-60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 50.3% of patients, moderate (GFR
30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 37.4%, and severe (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 12.3%.
After 32 ± 23 months, 68.7% of patients were receiving ACEi/ARBs and 40% were
receiving MRAs; 65.9% developed a cardiovascular event and 54.4% had died. After 
multivariate Cox regression analysis, ACEi/ARB treatment was independently
associated with a decreased rate of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.71 [95%
confidence interval 0.50-0.98]) and MRAs were not associated with a decrease in
cardiovascular events or total mortality.

receptors (MRs) have been noted. MR antagonists have been reported to show
significant antialbuminuric effects when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. However, a decrease in the
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been reported during MR
antagonist treatment. On the other hand, although the eGFR often decreases,
significant reductions in total mortality and cardiovascular events have been
observed in large-scale clinical trials in patients with chronic heart failure.
What are the implications of the changes in eGFR due to MR antagonist treatment? 
Glomerular hyperfiltration has been reported to occur with an aldosterone excess,
and it can be seen that relative glomerular hyperfiltration is rapidly corrected 
with MR antagonism, even without aldosterone excess. This is reflected in the
initial temporary decrease in the eGFR. After MR antagonist treatment, eGFR
decreases temporarily, and it appears that renal function has deteriorated.
However, if renal function has actually deteriorated, a reduction in all-cause
and cardiovascular death is unlikely to occur in the clinical studies in patients
with chronic heart failure. That is, the initial transient decrease in eGFR by
the MR antagonist appears to work effectively to provide fine adjustment of
glomerular pressure, and this approach works advantageously to suppress long-term
cardiovascular events. It is expected that a number of long-term, large-scale
clinical research trials targeting renal events and all-cause and cardiovascular 
death in CKD patients treated with an MR antagonist will be planned.",Captcha,NaN

CVII. Structure and Pharmacology of the Apelin Receptor with a Recommendation that Elabela/Toddler Is a Second Endogenous Peptide Ligand.,"The predicted protein encoded by the APJ gene discovered in 1993 was originally
classified as a class A G protein-coupled orphan receptor but was subsequently
paired with a novel peptide ligand, apelin-36 in 1998. Substantial research
identified a family of shorter peptides activating the apelin receptor, including
apelin-17, apelin-13, and [Pyr1]apelin-13, with the latter peptide predominating 
in human plasma and cardiovascular system. A range of pharmacological tools have 
been developed, including radiolabeled ligands, analogs with improved plasma
stability, peptides, and small molecules including biased agonists and
antagonists, leading to the recommendation that the APJ gene be renamed APLNR and
encode the apelin receptor protein. Recently, a second endogenous ligand has been
identified and called Elabela/Toddler, a 54-amino acid peptide originally
identified in the genomes of fish and humans but misclassified as noncoding. This
precursor is also able to be cleaved to shorter sequences (32, 21, and 11 amino
acids), and all are able to activate the apelin receptor and are blocked by
apelin receptor antagonists. This review summarizes the pharmacology of these
ligands and the apelin receptor, highlights the emerging physiologic and
pathophysiological roles in a number of diseases, and recommends that
Elabela/Toddler is a second endogenous peptide ligand of the apelin receptor
protein.

RESULTS: In patients with HF with AF, there was a significant trend of reduced
60-day and 1-year mortality rates and the composite end point with guideline
adherence. According to the Cox proportion hazard model, poor adherence was
associated with a significantly higher risk of 60-day mortality (HR 4.75; 95% CI 
1.77 to 12.74) and the composite end point (HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.18)

significantly higher risk of 1-year mortality compared with moderate (HR 1.64;
95% CI 1.15 to 2.33) and good adherence (HR 2.34; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.97) and with a
higher risk of the 1-year composite end point compared with good adherence (HR

    Lancet. 2019 Oct 12;394(10206):1300-1302.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the safety of edoxaban in combination with P2Y12
inhibition in patients with atrial fibrillation who had percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI).
METHODS: ENTRUST-AF PCI was a randomised, multicentre, open-label,
non-inferiority phase 3b trial with masked outcome evaluation, done at 186 sites 
in 18 countries. Patients had atrial fibrillation requiring oral anticoagulation,
were aged at least 18 years, and had a successful PCI for stable coronary artery 
disease or acute coronary syndrome. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1)
from 4 h to 5 days after PCI using concealed, stratified, and blocked web-based
central randomisation to either edoxaban (60 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12
inhibitor for 12 months or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in combination with a
P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (100 mg once daily, for 1-12 months). The edoxaban
dose was reduced to 30 mg per day if one or more factors (creatinine clearance
15-50 mL/min, bodyweight ≤60 kg, or concomitant use of specified potent
P-glycoprotein inhibitors) were present. The primary endpoint was a composite of 
major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding within 12 months. The
primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was
assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study
drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02866175, is closed to
new participants, and follow-up is completed.
FINDINGS: From Feb 24, 2017, through May 7, 2018, 1506 patients were enrolled and
randomly assigned to the edoxaban regimen (n=751) or VKA regimen (n=755). Median 
time from PCI to randomisation was 45·1 h (IQR 22·2-76·2). Major or CRNM bleeding
events occurred in 128 (17%) of 751 patients (annualised event rate 20·7%) with
the edoxaban regimen and 152 (20%) of 755 patients (annualised event rate 25·6%) 
patients with the VKA regimen; hazard ratio 0·83 (95% CI 0·65-1·05; p=0·0010 for 
non-inferiority, margin hazard ratio 1·20; p=0·1154 for superiority).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with atrial fibrillation who had PCI, the
edoxaban-based regimen was non-inferior for bleeding compared with the VKA-based 
regimen, without significant differences in ischaemic events.

three 60-min exercise sessions/week. The primary endpoints are the effect of
exercise on myocardial extracellular volume (ECV), left ventricular (LV) systolic
function, LV mass, LV mass-to-volume and LV cardiomyocyte volume. Secondary
endpoints include the effect of exercise on vasomotor endothelial function,
cardiac sympathetic activity and plasmatic biomarkers. Patients will be allocated

BACKGROUND: The development of deep neural networks is facilitating more advanced
digital analysis of histopathologic images. We trained a convolutional neural
network for multiclass segmentation of digitized kidney tissue sections stained
with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS).
METHODS: We trained the network using multiclass annotations from 40 whole-slide 
images of stained kidney transplant biopsies and applied it to four independent
data sets. We assessed multiclass segmentation performance by calculating Dice
coefficients for ten tissue classes on ten transplant biopsies from the Radboud
University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, and on ten transplant
biopsies from an external center for validation. We also fully segmented 15
nephrectomy samples and calculated the network's glomerular detection rates and
compared network-based measures with visually scored histologic components (Banff
classification) in 82 kidney transplant biopsies.
RESULTS: The weighted mean Dice coefficients of all classes were 0.80 and 0.84 in
ten kidney transplant biopsies from the Radboud center and the external center,
respectively. The best segmented class was ""glomeruli"" in both data sets (Dice
coefficients, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively), followed by ""tubuli combined"" and
""interstitium."" The network detected 92.7% of all glomeruli in nephrectomy
samples, with 10.4% false positives. In whole transplant biopsies, the mean
intraclass correlation coefficient for glomerular counting performed by
pathologists versus the network was 0.94. We found significant correlations
between visually scored histologic components and network-based measures.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first convolutional neural network for
multiclass segmentation of PAS-stained nephrectomy samples and transplant
biopsies. Our network may have utility for quantitative studies involving kidney 
histopathology across centers and provide opportunities for deep learning
applications in routine diagnostics.

heart transplantation are poorly characterized. A better understanding of this
phenomenon will help guide strategies to address the causes of readmission. Data 
from the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation for Children (CTOTC-04)
multi-institutional collaborative study were utilized to determine incidence of, 
and risk factors for, hospital readmission within 30 days and 1 year from initial
hospital discharge. Among 240 transplants at 8 centers, 227 subjects were
discharged and had follow-up. 129 subjects (56.8%) were readmitted within one
year; 71 had two or more readmissions. The 30-day and 1-year freedom from
readmission were 70.5% (CI: 64.1%, 76.0%) and 42.2% (CI: 35.7%, 48.7%),
respectively. The most common indications for readmissions were infection
followed by rejection and fever without confirmed infection, accounting for
25.0%, 10.6%, and 6.2% of readmissions, respectively. Factors independently
associated with increased risk of first readmission within 1 year (Cox
proportional hazard model) were as follows: transplant in infancy (P = .05),
longer transplant hospitalization (P = .04), lower UNOS urgency status (2/IB vs
1A) at transplant (P = .04), and Hispanic ethnicity (P = .05). Hospital
readmission occurs frequently in the first year following discharge after heart
transplantation with highest risk in the first 30 days. Infection is more common 
than rejection as cause for readmission, with death during readmission being
rare. A number of patient factors are associated with higher risk of readmission.
A fuller understanding of these risk factors may help tailor strategies to reduce
unnecessary hospital readmission.

(ART) face a two-fold increased risk of heart failure as compared with
non-HIV-infected individuals. The purpose of this review is to consider evolving 
risks, mechanisms, and preventive considerations pertaining to heart failure
among PHIV.
RECENT FINDINGS: While unchecked HIV/AIDS has been documented to precipitate
heart failure characterized by overtly reduced cardiac contractile function,
ART-treated HIV may be associated with either heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) or with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). 
In HFpEF, a ""stiff"" left ventricle cannot adequately relax in diastole-a
condition known as diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction, in turn, may
result from processes including myocardial fibrosis (triggered by hypertension
and/or immune activation/inflammation) and/or myocardial steatosis (triggered by 
metabolic dysregulation). Notably, hypertension, systemic immune activation, and 
metabolic dysregulation are all common conditions among even those PHIV who are
well-treated with ART. Of clinical consequence, HFpEF is uniquely intransigent to
conventional medical therapies and portends high morbidity and mortality.
However, diastolic dysfunction is reversible-as are contributing processes of
myocardial fibrosis and myocardial steatosis. Our challenges in preserving
myocardial health among PHIV are two-fold. First, we must continue working to
realize UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals. This achievement will reduce AIDS-related
mortality, including cardiovascular deaths from AIDS-associated heart failure.
Second, we must work to elucidate the detailed mechanisms continuing to
predispose ART-treated PHIV to heart failure and particularly HFpEF. Such efforts
will enable the development and implementation of targeted preventive strategies.",Captcha,NaN

sufficiently capture the earliest epigenetic priming event during the cell fate

in this single-center retrospective, institutional review board-approved,
HIPAA-compliant study. Follow-up was performed to record major adverse cardiac
events (MACE). Plaque quantification of lesions responsible for MACE and control 
lesions was retrospectively performed semiautomatically from cCTA together with
machine-learning based CT-FFR. The discriminatory value of plaque markers and
CT-FFR to predict MACE was evaluated. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months
(interquartile range 11.5 to 26.6 months), MACE was observed in 18 patients
(21%). In a multivariate analysis the following markers were predictors of MACE
(odds ratio [OR]): lesion length (OR 1.16, p = 0.018), low-attenuation plaque
(<30 HU) (OR 4.59, p = 0.003), Napkin ring sign (OR 2.71, p = 0.034), stenosis
≥50% (OR 3.83, p 0.042), and CT-FFR ≤0.80 (OR 7.78, p = 0.001). Receiver
operating characteristics analysis including stenosis ≥50%, plaque markers and
CT-FFR ≤0.80 (Area under the curve 0.94) showed incremental discriminatory power 
over stenosis ≥50% alone (Area under the curve 0.60, p <0.0001) for the
prediction of MACE. cCTA-derived plaque markers and machine-learning CT-FFR
demonstrate predictive value to identify MACE. In conclusion, combining plaque
markers with machine-learning CT-FFR shows incremental discriminatory power over 
cCTA stenosis grading alone.

impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short-term
and long-term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding
of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials
evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable
uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available
pharmacological interventions for this population.
OBJECTIVES: Primary objective1. To assess the effects of pharmacological
interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill
adults with confirmed or documented high risk of deliriumSecondary objectivesTo
assess the following:1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium-free
and coma-free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical
ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality;
and long-term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health-related
quality of life); and2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult
patients.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases from their inception date to 
21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also
searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), the
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of
Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites
using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for
Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and
abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including
quasi-RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically
ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug
treatment, placebo, or a non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We
did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of
administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically
ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac,
medical, surgical, trauma) or high-dependency unit.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies
from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction
and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through
pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network 
structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a
network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons
between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment
network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality
of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high.
MAIN RESULTS: We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844
participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo-controlled, and
four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were
the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha2 agonists (n = 3; all
dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin
antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1;
rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non-pharmacological
interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and
control groups.Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of 
the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the
smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the
alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27;
surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate-quality
evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best
interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA
0.738; moderate-quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA
0.578; very-low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 
0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high-quality evidence).The NMAs of multiple secondary
outcomes revealed that only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was associated
with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to
0.89; moderate-quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was
associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27;
moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these
trials or, when reported, were rare; pair-wise analysis of QTc prolongation in
seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics,
ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified trials of varying quality that examined six
different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We
found evidence that the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium
duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise
analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha2
agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of
ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU
stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms 
of delirium-free and coma-free days, days with coma, physical restraint use,
length of stay, long-term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported
delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing
studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once
published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31479532.pdf

BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether patients undergoing primary percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) benefit from genotype-guided selection of oral P2Y12 
inhibitors.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded trial in which
patients undergoing primary PCI with stent implantation were assigned in a 1:1
ratio to receive either a P2Y12 inhibitor on the basis of early CYP2C19 genetic
testing (genotype-guided group) or standard treatment with either ticagrelor or
prasugrel (standard-treatment group) for 12 months. In the genotype-guided group,
carriers of CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 loss-of-function alleles received ticagrelor
or prasugrel, and noncarriers received clopidogrel. The two primary outcomes were
net adverse clinical events - defined as death from any cause, myocardial
infarction, definite stent thrombosis, stroke, or major bleeding defined
according to Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) criteria - at 12
months (primary combined outcome; tested for noninferiority, with a
noninferiority margin of 2 percentage points for the absolute difference) and
PLATO major or minor bleeding at 12 months (primary bleeding outcome).
RESULTS: For the primary analysis, 2488 patients were included: 1242 in the
genotype-guided group and 1246 in the standard-treatment group. The primary
combined outcome occurred in 63 patients (5.1%) in the genotype-guided group and 
in 73 patients (5.9%) in the standard-treatment group (absolute difference, -0.7 
percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 0.7; P<0.001 for
noninferiority). The primary bleeding outcome occurred in 122 patients (9.8%) in 
the genotype-guided group and in 156 patients (12.5%) in the standard-treatment
group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing primary PCI, a CYP2C19 genotype-guided
strategy for selection of oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy was noninferior to
standard treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel at 12 months with respect to
thrombotic events and resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding. (Funded by the

hyperuricemia via reabsorption of uric acid in renal tubules, and its function is
regulated by several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SLC22A12 gene 
encoding URAT1. This study investigated whether the genetic predisposition of
URAT1 is associated with the mortality in general population.
METHODS: This study enrolled 1596 participants (male 45%, mean age 61 years) who 
registered at local health checkup in Takahata, Japan, and the association
between the rs505802 genotypes in SLC22A12 gene and the 7-year mortality, was
examined.
RESULTS: The serum uric acid levels (mean ± SD) at baseline in the subjects with 
GG and AG + AA genotypes of rs505802 were 5.1 ± 1.3 mg/dL and 5.0 ± 1.5 mg/dL,
respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the mortality was
nonsignificantly higher in the subjects with GG genotype than in those with
AG + AA genotype (P = 0.09). Cox proportional hazard model adjusted with age,
gender, renal function, comorbidities, and other possible confounders,
demonstrated that the GG genotype was significantly associated with the mortality
[hazard ratio (HR) 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-4.85, (vs. AG + AA
genotype)]. Furthermore, adjustment with serum uric acid levels, along with
aforementioned confounders retained the significant association (HR 2.26, 95% CI 
1.05-4.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the genetic predisposition of URAT1 was
independently associated with mortality in the Japanese community-based
population. This association might be due to the mechanism independent of serum

adult cardiac shape and function. Neonatal exposure to high oxygen, a rat model
of prematurity-related conditions, leads to cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and
dysfunction. TLR (Toll-like receptor) 4 signaling is a critical link between
oxidative stress, inflammation, and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. 
The current study sought to investigate the role of TLR4 signaling in neonatal
oxygen-induced cardiomyopathy. Male Sprague-Dawley pups were kept in 80% oxygen
or room air from day 3 to 10 of life and treated with TLR4 antagonist
lipopolysaccharide from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter
sphaeroides(LPS-RS) or saline. Echocardiography was performed at 4, 7, and 12
weeks. At 12 weeks, intraarterial blood pressure was measured before
euthanization for histological and biochemical analyses. At day 10, cardiac TLR4,
Il (interleukin) 18, and Il1β expression were increased in oxygen-exposed
compared with room air controls. At 4 weeks, compared with room air-saline,
saline-, but not LPS-RS treated-, oxygen-exposed animals, exhibited increased
left ventricle mass index, reduced ejection fraction, and cardiac output index.
Findings were similar at 7 and 12 weeks. LPS-RS did not influence
echocardiography in 12 weeks room air animals. Systolic blood pressure was higher
in saline- but not LPS-RS treated-oxygen-exposed animals compared with room
air-saline and -LPS-RS controls. LPS-RS prevented cardiac fibrosis and
cardiomyocytes hypertrophy, the increased TLR4, Myd88, and Il18 gene expression, 
TRIF expression, and CD68+ macrophages infiltration associated with neonatal
oxygen exposure, without impact in room air rats. This study indicates that

diagnosis and subsequent clinical decisions. V1 and V2 are commonly placed
superior of their correct position. The aim of the current study was to use
machine learning approaches to detect V1 and V2 lead misplacement to enhance ECG 
data quality.
METHOD: ECGs for 453 patients, (normal n = 151, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy
(LVH) n = 151, Myocardial Infarction n = 151) were extracted from body surface
potential maps. These were used to extract both the correct and incorrectly
placed V1 and V2 leads. The prevalence for correct and incorrect leads were 50%. 
Sixteen features were extracted in three different domains: time-based,
statistical and time-frequency features using a wavelet transform. A hybrid
feature selection approach was applied to select an optimal set of features. To
ensure optimal model selection, five classifiers were used and compared. The
aforementioned feature selection approach and classifiers were applied for V1 and
V2 misplacement in three different positions: first, second and third intercostal
spaces (ICS).
RESULTS: The accuracy for V1 misplacement detection was 93.9%, 89.3%, 72.8% in
the first, second and third ICS respectively. In V2, the accuracy was 93.6%,
86.6% and 68.1% in the first, second and third ICS respectively. There is a
noticeable decline in accuracy when detecting misplacement in the third ICS which
is expected.

BACKGROUND: The relative merits of ticagrelor as compared with prasugrel in
patients with acute coronary syndromes for whom invasive evaluation is planned
are uncertain.
METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we randomly assigned 
patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes and for whom invasive
evaluation was planned to receive either ticagrelor or prasugrel. The primary end
point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year. A
major secondary end point (the safety end point) was bleeding.
RESULTS: A total of 4018 patients underwent randomization. A primary end-point
event occurred in 184 of 2012 patients (9.3%) in the ticagrelor group and in 137 
of 2006 patients (6.9%) in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.70; P = 0.006). The respective incidences of 
the individual components of the primary end point in the ticagrelor group and
the prasugrel group were as follows: death, 4.5% and 3.7%; myocardial infarction,
4.8% and 3.0%; and stroke, 1.1% and 1.0%. Definite or probable stent thrombosis
occurred in 1.3% of patients assigned to ticagrelor and 1.0% of patients assigned
to prasugrel, and definite stent thrombosis occurred in 1.1% and 0.6%,
respectively. Major bleeding (as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research
Consortium scale) was observed in 5.4% of patients in the ticagrelor group and in
4.8% of patients in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.83 to
1.51; P = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes with or
without ST-segment elevation, the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or
stroke was significantly lower among those who received prasugrel than among
those who received ticagrelor, and the incidence of major bleeding was not
significantly different between the two groups. (Funded by the German Center for

BACKGROUND: The angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril-valsartan
led to a reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from
cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection
fraction. The effect of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is unclear.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 4822 patients with New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, ejection fraction of 45% or higher, elevated
level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease to receive
sacubitril-valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan
twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily). The primary outcome 
was a composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from
cardiovascular causes. Primary outcome components, secondary outcomes (including 
NYHA class change, worsening renal function, and change in Kansas City
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] clinical summary score [scale, 0 to 100, with
higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations]), and safety
were also assessed.
RESULTS: There were 894 primary events in 526 patients in the
sacubitril-valsartan group and 1009 primary events in 557 patients in the
valsartan group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01;
P = 0.06). The incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was 8.5% in the
sacubitril-valsartan group and 8.9% in the valsartan group (hazard ratio, 0.95;
95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16); there were 690 and 797 total hospitalizations for heart
failure, respectively (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.00). NYHA class
improved in 15.0% of the patients in the sacubitril-valsartan group and in 12.6% 
of those in the valsartan group (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86); renal
function worsened in 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.33 to 0.77). The mean change in the KCCQ clinical summary score at 8 months was
1.0 point (95% CI, 0.0 to 2.1) higher in the sacubitril-valsartan group. Patients
in the sacubitril-valsartan group had a higher incidence of hypotension and
angioedema and a lower incidence of hyperkalemia. Among 12 prespecified
subgroups, there was suggestion of heterogeneity with possible benefit with
sacubitril-valsartan in patients with lower ejection fraction and in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril-valsartan did not result in a significantly lower rate of
total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes
among patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 45% or higher.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data from randomized trials evaluating the use of
antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary
artery disease.
METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label trial conducted in Japan, we randomly
assigned 2236 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1
year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease not
requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban (a
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant) or combination therapy with
rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The primary efficacy end point was 
a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina 
requiring revascularization, or death from any cause; this end point was analyzed
for noninferiority with a noninferiority margin of 1.46. The primary safety end
point was major bleeding, according to the criteria of the International Society 
on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; this end point was analyzed for superiority.
RESULTS: The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the
combination-therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination
therapy for the primary efficacy end point, with event rates of 4.14% and 5.75%
per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.55 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior
to combination therapy for the primary safety end point, with event rates of
1.62% and 2.76% per patient-year, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 
to 0.89; P = 0.01 for superiority).
CONCLUSIONS: As antithrombotic therapy, rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior
to combination therapy for efficacy and superior for safety in patients with
atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease. (Funded by the Japan

cause of cardiovascular disease. The effect of cooking oils depends on their
fatty acid composition. Therefore, it is important to blend different types of
oils to improve functional properties. In this study we evaluated the effects of 
a functional blended oil (BO) composed of a high level of oleic acid (OA)
(50.93%) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (5.41%) on cardiovascular health, blood
pressure (BP) and body weight (BW) in comparison with lard oil (LO) and peanut
oil (PO). Ninety male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and fed for 12
weeks with BO, LO and PO. Each group was divided into low, middle and high fat
groups and fed with oil supply ratios of 6.7%, 10.9% and 48.1%, respectively.
After the feeding period, the rats were sacrificed, and data were collected and
analyzed. Rats treated with BO especially at a high dose (HBO) showed a
significantly lower body weight, fat weight, liver weight, fat ratio, food intake
and energy intake. BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and
adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid
anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein
(MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA). In terms of antioxidant 
enzymes, BO treatment has increased the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione
peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA)
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues. Moreover, BO supplementation showed
a significant lowering effect on the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), blood pressure (BP), atherosclerosis index
(AI) and heart rate (HR). These findings highlight that the new blend of canola
oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil with a low n-6/n-3 PUFA
ratio of 6 : 1 could prevent and control cardiovascular disease (CVD).",Captcha,NaN

with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the number of positive cases constantly
increases every day. Thus, the aim of this research is to describe the level of
AD knowledge among community pharmacists and general practitioners in Spain, in
order to see where the biggest gaps in the knowledge are. Therefore, a
cross-sectional study has been carried out, using the Alzheimer's disease
knowledge survey (ADKS), among members of the Spanish Society of Primary Care
Physicians and the Spanish Society of Family and Community Pharmacy to report the
differences in AD knowledge in both professional collectives. The ADKS has been
responded by 578 community pharmacists and 104 general practitioners and consists
of a battery of 30 questions, whose possible answers are true or false. It
assesses the AD knowledge in seven areas (impact on the disease, risk factors,
course of the disease, diagnosis, care, treatment and symptoms). Results indicate
that Spanish pharmacists and general practitioners have a high personal knowledge
of AD, nevertheless, it is not associated with greater awareness. Both scored
above 80% at the categories: diagnostic, treatment and symptoms. However, lower
knowledge level (60% of correct answers) was found in those related to risk
factors, such as the ignorance about hypercholesterolemia or hypertension as risk
factors for the disease. Community pharmacists are already acting to control
cardiovascular risk factors, but a wider knowledge of the relationship of these
factors to AD is needed to act against these silent risk factors. Thus,
pharmacists may also be involved in the management of AD that includes
recognizing early symptoms for early detection of cognitive impairment. Hence,
knowledge about risk factors is very important in developing this expanding role.",Captcha,NaN

Is the cardiometabolic risk similar or are there differences?,"OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in the cardiometabolic profile between
patients with non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas (NFAI) and incidentalomas
with autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS).
METHODS: A total of 149 patients with adrenal incidentalomas were retrospectively
evaluated and followed-up for a mean time of 34.6 months at Departments of
Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases Units of four tertiary Spanish hospitals.
Patients were grouped as NFAI or ACS adenomas based on two cutoffs in the
dexamethasone suppression test (DST): 3.0 µg/dl (NFAIDST3 or ACSDST3) and
1.8 µg/dl (ACSDST1.8 and NFAIDST1.8).
RESULTS: The mean age of both groups was 62.0 (10.31) and was similar in ACS and 
NFAI. The prevalence of diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular, and
cerebrovascular disease was higher in ACS than in NFAI, but differences only
reached statistical significance for cerebrovascular disease using the 3.0 µg/dl 
cutoff (15.8% vs 2.3%, p = 0.01) and for diabetes using the 1.8 µg/dl cutoff
(38.0% vs 22.0%, p = 0.04). No differences were found in the prevalence of
dyslipidemia. The prevalence of obesity was lower in patients with ACS than in
NFAI 26.3% vs 39.2%, p = 0.18 (NFAIDST3 vs ACSDST3) and 32.1% vs 40.6%, p = 0.56 
(ACSDST1.8 vs NFAIDST1.8), but the differences did not reach statistical
significance. Maximum adenoma diameter (R-squared = 0.15, p < 0.001) and
cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.59, p = 0.04) were the only parameters that could
be predicted by the DST. The DST was an inadequate predictor of clinical
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index), hormonal (DHEAS, ACTH, 
UFC, and basal serum cortisol), biochemical (glucose, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and 
triglycerides), and other radiological (laterality, lipid content) parameters.
Throughout the follow-up, patients did not develop overt Cushing's Syndrome;
three NFAIDST3 developed ACSDST3, eight NFAIDST1.8 developed ACSDST1.8, and one
NFAIDST1.8 progressed to ACSDST3. In both groups (NFAI and ACS) the metabolic
profile remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest higher prevalence of diabetes and cerebrovascular
disease in ACS patients compared with NFAI. However, probably because of the
small sample size, the differences only reached statistical significance using
the cutoffs of 1.8 µg/dl for diabetes and 3.0 µg/dl for cerebrovascular disease. 
Patients with ACS and NFAI rarely progress to more aggressive forms of
hypercortisolism, and the metabolic profile usually remains stable during the
follow-up.",Captcha,NaN

algorithms have been developed to guide clinical decisions like with ST segment
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) where time in decision making is
critical. These computer-generated diagnoses have been proven to strongly
influence the final ECG diagnosis by the clinician; often called automation bias.
However, the computerised diagnosis may be inaccurate and could result in a wrong
or delayed treatment harm to the patient. We hypothesise that an algorithmic
certainty index alongside a computer-generated diagnosis might mitigate
automation bias. The impact of reporting a certainty index on the final diagnosis
is not known.
PURPOSE: To ascertain whether knowledge of the computer-generated ECG algorithmic
certainty index influences operator diagnostic accuracy.
METHODOLOGY: Clinicians who regularly analyse ECGs such as cardiology or acute
care doctors, cardiac nurses and ambulance staff were invited to complete an
online anonymous survey between March and April 2019. The survey had 36 ECGs with
a clinical vignette of a typical chest pain and which were either a STEMI,
normal, or borderline (but do not fit the STEMI criteria) along with an
artificially created certainty index that was either high, medium, low or none.
Participants were asked whether the ECG showed a STEMI and their confidence in
the diagnosis. The primary outcomes were whether a computer-generated certainty
index influenced interpreter's diagnostic decisions and improved their diagnostic
accuracy. Secondary outcomes were influence of certainty index between different 
types of clinicians and influence of certainty index on user's own-diagnostic
confidence.
RESULTS: A total of 91 participants undertook the survey and submitted 3262 ECG
interpretations of which 75% of ECG interpretations were correct. Presence of a
certainty index significantly increased the odds ratio of a correct ECG
interpretation (OR 1.063, 95% CI 1.022-1.106, p = 0.004) but there was no
significant difference between correct certainty index and incorrect certainty
index (OR 1.028, 95% CI 0.923-1.145, p = 0.615). There was a trend for low
certainty index to increase odds ratio compared to no certainty index (OR 1.153, 
95% CI 0.898-1.482, p = 0.264) but a high certainty index significantly decreased
the odds ratio of a correct ECG interpretation (OR 0.492, 95% CI 0.391-0.619,
p < 0.001). There was no impact of presence of a certainty index (p = 0.528) or
correct certainty index (p = 0.812) on interpreters' confidence in their ECG
interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the presence of an ECG certainty index
improves the users ECG interpretation accuracy. This effect is not seen with
differing levels of confidence within a certainty index, with reduced ECG
interpretation success with a high certainty index compared with a trend for
increased success with a low certainty index. This suggests that a certainty
index improves interpretation when there is an increased element of doubt,
possibly forcing the ECG user to spend more time and effort analysing the ECG.
Further research is needed looking at time spent analysing differing certainty
indices with alternate ECG diagnoses.

need to prevent and predict dementia among the general population. The
availability of national time-series health examination data in South Korea
provides an opportunity to use deep learning algorithm, an artificial
intelligence technology, to expedite the analysis of mass and sequential data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the discriminative accuracy between a
time-series deep learning algorithm and conventional statistical methods to
predict all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia using periodic health
examination data.
METHODS: Diagnostic codes in medical claims data from a South Korean national
health examination cohort were used to identify individuals who developed
dementia or Alzheimer dementia over a 10-year period. As a result, 479,845 and
465,081 individuals, who were aged 40 to 79 years and without all-cause dementia 
and Alzheimer dementia, respectively, were identified at baseline. The
performance of the following 3 models was compared with predictions of which
individuals would develop either type of dementia: Cox proportional hazards model
using only baseline data (HR-B), Cox proportional hazards model using repeated
measurements (HR-R), and deep learning model using repeated measurements (DL-R).
RESULTS: The discrimination indices (95% CI) for the HR-B, HR-R, and DL-R models 
to predict all-cause dementia were 0.84 (0.83-0.85), 0.87 (0.86-0.88), and 0.90
(0.90-0.90), respectively, and those to predict Alzheimer dementia were 0.87
(0.86-0.88), 0.90 (0.88-0.91), and 0.91 (0.91-0.91), respectively. The DL-R model
showed the best performance, followed by the HR-R model, in predicting both types
of dementia. The DL-R model was superior to the HR-R model in all validation
groups tested.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning algorithm using time-series data can be an accurate 
and cost-effective method to predict dementia. A combination of deep learning and
proportional hazards models might help to enhance prevention strategies for
dementia.

patients converge to suggest a key role of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the
pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD). However, the molecular mechanisms involved
in the development of cardiovascular lesions during KD vasculitis are still
unknown. Here, we investigated intestinal barrier function in KD vasculitis and
observed evidence of intestinal permeability and elevated circulating secretory
immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in KD patients, as well as elevated sIgA and IgA
deposition in vascular tissues in a mouse model of KD vasculitis. Targeting
intestinal permeability corrected gut permeability, prevented IgA deposition and 
ameliorated cardiovascular pathology in the mouse model. Using genetic and
pharmacologic inhibition of IL-1β signaling, we demonstrate that IL-1β lies
upstream of disrupted intestinal barrier function, subsequent IgA vasculitis
development, and cardiac inflammation. Targeting mucosal barrier dysfunction and 
the IL-1β pathway may also be applicable to other IgA-related diseases, including
IgA vasculitis and IgA nephropathy.

Predicting Adverse Catastrophic Events (FAST-PACE) solution for preparing
immediate intervention in emergency situations. FAST-PACE utilizes a concise set 
of collected features to construct an artificial intelligence model that predicts
the onset of cardiac arrest or acute respiratory failure from 1 h to 6 h prior to
its occurrence. Data from the trajectory of 29,181 patients in intensive care
units of two hospitals includes periodic vital signs, a history of treatment,
current health status, and recent surgery. It excludes the results of laboratory 
data to construct a feasible application in wards, out-hospital emergency care,
emergency transport, or other clinical situations where instant medical decisions
are required with restricted patient data. These results are superior to previous
warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the National
Early Warning Score (NEWS). The primary outcome was the feasibility of an
artificial intelligence (AI) model predicting adverse events 1 h to 6 h prior to 
occurrence without lab data; the area under the receiver operating characteristic

cardiac arrest and 0.341 for predicting respiratory failure) and NEWS (net
reclassification improvement of 0.412 for predicting cardiac arrest and 0.215 for

the cytoskeleton of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We mapped the
proteome of the annuli in Toxoplasma by reciprocal proximity biotinylation
(BioID), and validated five apical annuli proteins (AAP1-5), Centrin2, and an
apical annuli methyltransferase. Moreover, inner membrane complex (IMC) suture
proteins connecting the alveolar vesicles were also detected and support annuli
residence within the sutures. Super-resolution microscopy identified a concentric
organisation comprising four rings with diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm. The
high prevalence of domain signatures shared with centrosomal proteins in the AAPs
together with Centrin2 suggests that the annuli are related and/or derived from
the centrosomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the AAPs are conserved
narrowly in coccidian, apicomplexan parasites that multiply by an internal
budding mechanism. This suggests a role in replication, for example, to provide
pores in the mother IMC permitting exchange of building blocks and waste
products. However, presence of multiple signalling domains and proteins are
suggestive of additional functions. Knockout of AAP4, the most conserved compound
forming the largest ring-like structure, modestly decreased parasite fitness in
vitro but had no significant impact on acute virulence in vivo. In conclusion,
the apical annuli are composed of coiled-coil and signalling proteins assembled
in a pore-like structure crossing the IMC barrier maintained during internal
budding.

mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) and to assess the changes in these findings after
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Methods A retrospective clinical cohort study
was conducted on patients who were diagnosed with MPS between 1995 and 2018 in
Hacettepe University, Division of Pediatric Metabolism. A total of 96 patients
were diagnosed with MPS during the study period. Of these patients, 81 (84.3%)
received ERT. Echocardiographic findings of the patients together with the 6-min 
walking test (6MWT) results before and after ERT were compared. Results
Thirty-one participants (38.2%) were female, while 50 (61.8%) were male. The mean
age of the participants was 11.97 ± 6.33 years (range: 1.8-30). Five patients
(6.2%) had MPS type I, 14 (17.3%) had type II, 28 (34.6%) had type IVa, 33
(40.7%) had type VI and one (1.2%) had type VII. Before ERT, 69.4% of patients
had mitral insufficiency (MI; mild: 40.5%, moderate: 16.5%, severe: 12.7%), 35.4%
had aortic insufficiency (AI; mild: 22.8%, moderate: 12.7%) and 45.1% had

the ERT was 3.5 years. The ERT significantly improved left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH), but all other study variables returned non-significant before 
and after treatment. ERT may improve LVH in MPS. Bearing in mind that MPS is a
progressive disease, ERT seems to prevent significant deterioration of this
ailment but is not able to reverse the already settled pathologies except for
LVH. ERT is not able to reverse the damage, but provides stabilization; so it is 
best to initiate treatment before cardiac damage.",Captcha,NaN

neuroendocrine tumors pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), we performed
first time in-depth characterization of lincRNA expression profiles and
correlated findings to clinical outcomes of the disease. RNA-Seq data from
patients with PCPGs and 17 other tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and
other published sources were obtained. Differential expression analysis and a
machine-learning model were used to identify transcripts specific to PCPGs, as
well as established PCPG molecular subtypes. Similarly, lincRNAs specific to
aggressive PCPGs were identified, and univariate and multivariate analysis was
performed for metastasis-free survival. The results were validated in independent
samples using RT-PCR. From a pan-cancer context, PCPGs had a specific and unique 
lincRNA profile. Among PCPGs, five different molecular subtypes were identified
corresponding to the established molecular classification. Upregulation of 13
lincRNAs was found to be associated with aggressive/metastatic PCPGs. RT-PCR
validation confirmed the overexpression of four lincRNAs in metastatic compared
to non-metastatic PCPGs. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified five lincRNAs as
prognostic markers for metastasis-free survival of patients in three subtypes of 
PCPGs. Stratification of PCPG patients with a risk-score formulated using
multivariate analysis of lincRNA expression profiles, presence of key driver
mutations, tumor location, and hormone secretion profiles showed significant
differences in metastasis-free survival. PCPGs thus exhibit a specific lincRNA
expression profile that also corresponds to the established molecular subgroups
and can be potential marker for the aggressive/metastatic PCPGs.

ADHF-related hospitalization and ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for systolic or
diastolic heart failure between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014. Data
partitioned into training (60%), validation (20%) and test sets (20%) were used

logistic regression, and stepwise logistic regression. Performance across models 
was assessed by comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), cumulative
lift, misclassification rate, the number of input variables and the order of
selection/variable importance. Results: In the HFrEF (N = 83,000) and HFpEF
(N = 123,644) cohorts, 30 day all-cause mortality rates were 6.6% and 5.5%,

stepwise logistic regression models performed best across both cohorts, having
good discrimination (test set ROC of 0.75 for both 30 day mortality models and
0.74 for both 1 year mortality models) and the lowest number of input variables

hospitalized Medicare patients with HFrEF or HFpEF were developed and found to
have good predictive ability with ROCs of greater than or equal to 0.74 and a

BACKGROUND: Although carvedilol therapy is recommended among certain patients
with HF, the safety and efficacy of carvedilol among HF patients with a CUD is
unknown.
METHODS: This was a single-center study of hospitalized patients with HF. Cocaine
use was self-reported or defined as having a positive urine toxicology. Patients 
were divided by carvedilol prescription. Subgroup analyses were performed by
strata of ejection fraction (EF) ≤40%, 41% to 49%, or ≥50%. Major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as cardiovascular mortality and 30-day 
HF readmission.
RESULTS: From a cohort of 2,578 patients hospitalized with HF in 2011, 503
patients with a CUD were identified, among whom 404 (80%) were prescribed
carvedilol, and 99 (20%) were not. Both groups had similar characteristics;
however, those prescribed carvedilol had a lower LVEF, heart rate, and N-terminal
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations at admission and on discharge, and 
more coronary artery disease. Over a median follow-up of 19 months, there were
169 MACEs. The MACE rates were similar between the carvedilol and the
non-carvedilol groups (32% vs. 38%, respectively; p = 0.16) and between those
with a preserved EF (30% vs. 33%, respectively; p = 0.48) and were lower in
patients with a reduced EF taking carvedilol (34% vs. 58%, respectively;
p = 0.02). In a multivariate model, carvedilol therapy was associated with lower 
MACE among patients with HF with a CUD (hazard ratio: 0.67; 95% confidence
interval; 0.481 to 0.863).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that carvedilol therapy is safe for patients
with HF with a CUD and may be effective among those with a reduced EF.

treatment planning. The dose prescription, deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH)
amplitude, heart volume, lung volume, V90% and mean heart dose were used to
predict the increase in dose to the heart when a shift towards the treatment
field was undertaken. The network was trained using 3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm shifts in
heart positions for 50 patients' giving 150 data points in total. The neural
network architecture was also varied to find the most optimal network design. The
final neural network was then tested using cross-validation to evaluate the
model's ability to generalise to new data.
RESULTS: The optimal neural network found was comprised of a single hidden layer 
of 30 neurons. Based on twenty train/test splits, 94% of all prediction errors
were below 0.2 Gy, 97.3% were below 0.3 Gy and 100% were below 0.5 Gy. The
average RMSE and maximum prediction error over all train/test splits were 0.13 Gy
and 0.5 Gy respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach using a neural network provides a clinically acceptable
estimate of the increase in Mean Heart Dose (MHD), without the need for further
imaging, contouring or evaluation. The trained neural network gives clinicians
the information and tools required to evaluate what shift in heart position would
be acceptable and which scenarios require immediate action before treatment
continues.

quantitative diagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we
present a novel fully automatic left ventricle segmentation approach based on
convolutional neural networks. The proposed network fully takes advantages of the
hierarchical architecture and integrate the multi-scale feature together for
segmenting the myocardial region of LV. Moreover, we put forward a dynamic
pixel-wise weighting strategy, which can dynamically adjust the weight of each
pixel according to the segmentation accuracy of upper layer and force the pixel
classifier to take more attention on the misclassified ones. By this way, the LV 
segmentation performance of our method can be improved a lot especially for the
apical and basal slices in cine MR images. The experiments on the CAP database
demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement compared with
other well-know deep learning methods. Beside these, we discussed two major
limitations in convolutional neural networks-based semantic segmentation methods 
for LV segmentation.

radiation mitigator of the gastrointestinal (GI) acute radiation syndrome (ARS), 
identified in an unbiased high-throughput screen. We used mice irradiated with a 
lethal dose of radiation and treated with daily injections of the radiation
mitigator 1-[(4-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-phenylpiperazine to study its effects on 
key pathways involved in intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance. RNASeq,
quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and
immunohistochemistry were performed to identify pathways engaged after drug
treatment. Target validation was performed with competition assays, reporter
cells, and in silico docking. 1-[(4-Nitrophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-phenylpiperazine
activates Hedgehog signaling by binding to the transmembrane domain of
Smoothened, thereby expanding the ISC pool, increasing the number of regenerating
crypts and preventing the GI-ARS. We conclude that Smoothened is a target for
radiation mitigation in the small intestine that could be explored for use in
radiation accidents as well as to mitigate normal tissue toxicity during and
after radiotherapy of the abdomen.

METHODS: Two CVD prediction models were developed from National Health Insurance 
Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS): a Cox regression model and a DL
model. Performance of each model was assessed in the internal and 2 external
validation cohorts in Koreans (National Health Insurance Service-National Sample 
Cohort; NHIS-NSC) and in Europeans (Rotterdam Study). A total of 412,030 adults
in the NHIS-HEALS; 178,875 adults in the NHIS-NSC; and the 4,296 adults in

RESULTS: Mean ages was 52 years (46% women) and there were 25,777 events (6.3%)
in NHIS-HEALS during the follow-up. In internal validation, the DL approach
demonstrated a C-statistic of 0.896 (95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.907) in men
and 0.921 (0.908-0.934) in women and improved reclassification compared with Cox 
regression (net reclassification index [NRI], 24.8% in men, 29.0% in women). In
external validation with NHIS-NSC, DL demonstrated a C-statistic of 0.868
(0.860-0.876) in men and 0.889 (0.876-0.898) in women, and improved
reclassification compared with Cox regression (NRI, 24.9% in men, 26.2% in
women). In external validation applied to the Rotterdam Study, DL demonstrated a 
C-statistic of 0.860 (0.824-0.897) in men and 0.867 (0.830-0.903) in women, and
improved reclassification compared with Cox regression (NRI, 36.9% in men, 31.8%

increased cardiovascular risk. Cortisol autonomy is defined by the overnight 1 mg
dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Saliva cortisol is an easier, stress-free, 
and cost-effective alternative to serum cortisol. We compared 23 h and post-1 mg 
DST saliva with serum cortisol to identify SCH in adrenal incidentalomas (AI).
METHODS: We analyzed 359 DST obtained retrospectively from 226 AI subjects
(173F/53 M; 19-83 years) for saliva and serum cortisol. We used three post-DST
serum cortisol cutoffs to uncover SCH: 1.8, 2.5, and 5.0 μg/dL. We determined
post-DST and 23 h saliva cortisol cutoffs by ROC curve analysis and calculated
their sensitivities (S) and specificities (E).
RESULTS: The sensitive 1.8 μg/dL cutoff defined 137 SCH and 180 non-functioning
adenomas (NFA): post-DST and 23 h saliva cortisol S/E were: 75.2%/74.4% and
59.5%/65.9%, respectively. Using the specific 5.0 μg/dL cortisol cutoff (22
SCH/295 NFA), post-DST and 23 h saliva cortisol S/E were 86.4%/83.4% and
66.7%/80.4%, respectively. Using the intermediate 2.5 μg/dL cutoff (89 SCH/228
NFA), post-DST and 23 h saliva cortisol S/E were 80.9%/68.9% and 65.5%/62.8%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Saliva cortisol showed acceptable performance only with the 5.0 μg/dL
cortisol cutoff, as in overt Cushing's syndrome. Lower cutoffs (1.8 and
2.5 μg/dL) that identify larger samples of patients with poor metabolic outcomes 
are less accurate for screening. These results may be attributed to
pre-analytical factors and inherent patient conditions. Thus, saliva cortisol
cannot replace serum cortisol to identify SCH among patients with AI for
screening DST.",Captcha,NaN

    J Gastrointest Cancer. 2019 Dec 11;:.

INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgical resection
is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Radiomics
can be used as noninvasive biomarker for prediction of response to therapy. The
main aim of this study was to evaluate the association of MRI texture features of
LARC with nCRT response and the effect of Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter and 
feature selection algorithm in prediction process improvement.
METHODS: All patients underwent MRI with a 3T clinical scanner, 1 week before
nCRT. For each patient, intensity, shape, and texture-based features were derived
from MRI images with LoG filter using the IBEX software and without
preprocessing. We identified responder from a non-responder group using 9 machine
learning classifiers. Then, the effect of preprocessing LoG filters with 0.5, 1
and 1.5 value on these classification algorithms' performance was investigated.
Eventually, classification algorithm's results were compared in different feature
selection methods.
RESULT: Sixty-seven patients with LARC were included in the study. Patients' nCRT
responses included 11 patients with Grade 0, 19 with Grade 1, 26 with Grade 2,
and 11 with Grade 3 according to AJCC/CAP pathologic grading. In MR Images which 
were not preprocessed, the best performance was for Ada boost classifier
(AUC = 74.8) with T2W MR Images. In T1W MR Images, the best performance was for
aba boost classifier (AUC = 78.1) with a σ = 1 preprocessing LoG filter. In T2W
MR Images, the best performance was for naive Bayesian network classifier
(AUC = 85.1) with a σ = 0.5 preprocessing LoG filter. Also, performance of
machine learning models with CfsSubsetEval (CF SUB E) feature selection algorithm
was better than others.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning can be used as a response predictor model in LARC
patients, but its performance should be improved. A preprocessing LoG filter can 
improve the machine learning methods performance and at the end, the effect of
feature selection algorithm on model's performance is clear.",Captcha,NaN

syndrome share characteristic findings affecting multiple organ systems, the
phenotypic spectrum is wide, ranging from a milder or attenuated phenotype to a
severe phenotype with early lethal complications. Costello syndrome is typically 
characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal
feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual
disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip);
curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar
creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint
laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons;
and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic
stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially
chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial
tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal
cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation
with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals
with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant
tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and
transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband
with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous HRAS pathogenic variant
identified by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Failure to thrive is the most common and
challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy
feeding; many require Nissen fundoplication. Treatment of cardiac manifestations 
and malignancy is routine. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often
requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles
tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental disability
requires early-intervention programs and individualized education strategies.
Recurrent facial papillomata may require routine removal with dry ice.
Hemodynamically significant valvar stenoses require antibiotic prophylaxis for
subacute bacterial endocarditis; anesthesia may pose a risk to those with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to some types of atrial
tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography
with electrocardiogram at diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist
who is aware of the spectrum of cardiac disease and its natural history;
abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and
neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be
considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder
cancer beginning at age ten years.
GENETIC COUNSELING: Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant
manner. To date, most probands with Costello syndrome have the disorder as the
result of a de novo pathogenic variant; although parents of probands are not
affected, vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, 
attenuated phenotype. Because Costello syndrome is typically caused by a de novo 
pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is presumed to be small;
however, recurrence in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result
of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with Costello syndrome typically
do not reproduce. Once an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an
affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and
preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

mechanisms. Recent therapeutic attention has focused on enhancing or augmenting
the neuroprotective actions of astrocytes but in some instances astrocytes can
assume a neurotoxic phenotype. The signaling mechanisms that drive astrocytes
toward a protective versus toxic phenotype are not fully known but cell-cell
signaling via proteases acting on cell-specific receptors underlies critical
mechanistic steps in neurodevelopment and disease. The protease activated
receptor (PAR), resides in multiple brain cell types, and most PARs are found on 
astrocytes. We asked whether neuron-generated thrombin constituted an important
astrocyte activation signal because our previous studies have shown that neurons 
contain prothrombin gene and transcribed protein. We used neuron and astrocyte
mono-cell cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and a model of middle
cerebral artery occlusion. We found that ischemic neurons secrete thrombin into
culture media, which leads to astrocyte activation; such astrocyte activation can
be reproduced with low doses of thrombin. Media from prothrombin-deficient
neurons failed to activate astrocytes and adding thrombin to such media restored 
activation. Astrocytes lacking PAR1 did not respond to neuron-generated thrombin.
Induced astrocyte activation was antagonized dose-dependently with thrombin
inhibitors or PAR1 antagonists. Ischemia-induced astrocyte activation in vivo was
inhibited after neuronal prothrombin knockout, resulting in larger strokes.
Restoring prothrombin to neurons with a lentiviral gene vector restored astrocyte
activation and reduced stroke damage. We conclude that neuron-generated thrombin,
released during ischemia, acts via PAR1 and may cause astrocyte activation and
paracrine neuroprotection.

induction, which might cause ischemic stroke, myocardial injury, acute kidney
injury and postoperative mortality, should be prevented. Anesthesiologists are
familiar with ultrasound examination of the internal jugular vein (IJV). This
study aimed to clarify whether ultrasonographic IJV evaluation just before
induction could predict the occurrence of such hypotension.
METHODS: Adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled
after excluding patients with cardiovascular disease or ASA-PS ≥ III.
Ultrasonographic IJV images were recorded in both the supine and 10°
Trendelenburg positions immediately before induction. Using these images, IJV
area (IJV-A), diameter and change rate with posture were measured. Hypotension
during induction was defined as mean BP < 60 mmHg or > 30% decrease from
baseline.
RESULTS: Hypotension during induction was observed in 37 of 82 patients. IJV-A in
the Trendelenburg position was 2.02 ± 0.86 and 1.72 ± 0.68 in the hypotensive and
non-hypotensive groups, respectively (P = 0.08). Logistic regression analysis
performed using age, use of calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, baseline mean BP and IJV-A in the
Trendelenburg position as variables showed that IJV-A in the Trendelenburg
position was an independent predictor of hypotension, with an adjusted odds ratio

and can induce cardiac pathology, but this has been difficult to study due to a
lack of small animal models. In humans, polymorphisms in the gene encoding the
antiviral restriction factor IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) are
associated with susceptibility to severe influenza, but whether IFITM3
deficiencies contribute to cardiac dysfunction during infection is unclear. We
show that IFITM3 deficiency in a new knockout (KO) mouse model increases weight
loss and mortality following influenza virus infections. We investigated this
enhanced pathogenesis with the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) influenza virus strain,
which is lethal in KO mice even at low doses, and observed increased replication 
of virus in the lungs, spleens, and hearts of KO mice compared with wild-type
(WT) mice. Infected IFITM3 KO mice developed aberrant cardiac electrical
activity, including decreased heart rate and irregular, arrhythmic RR (interbeat)
intervals, whereas WT mice exhibited a mild decrease in heart rate without
irregular RR intervals. Cardiac electrical dysfunction in PR8-infected KO mice
was accompanied by increased activation of fibrotic pathways and fibrotic lesions
in the heart. Infection with a sublethal dose of a less virulent influenza virus 
strain (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) resulted in a milder cardiac electrical dysfunction in

Several biologic 
variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences 
on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be
trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and
self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that
discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a
physiological measure of health.
METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from
499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate
cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with
multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess
within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation.
RESULTS: Of 275 056 patients tested, 52% were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2
years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4% classification accuracy
with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was
estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years
(R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at
least 2 decades of life, most patients (51%) had an average error between real
age and CNN-predicted age of <7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a
CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by >7 years included: low
ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P<0.01). In the 27% of
patients where correlation was >0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no
incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of
patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence

been conducted on a daily time scale, while hourly associations remain unclear.
METHODS: We collected the hourly data of emergency ambulance calls (EACs),
ambient air pollution, and meteorological variables from 2014 to 2016 in Luoyang,
a central Chinese city in Henan Province. We used a generalized additive model to
estimate the hourly effects of ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2)
on EACs for all natural causes and cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity, with
adjustment for potential confounding factors. We further examined the effect
modification by temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric
pressure using stratified analyses.
RESULTS: In the single-pollutant models, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were
associated with an immediate increase in all-cause morbidity at 0, 0, 12, 10 h,
separately, after exposure to these pollutants (excess risks: 0.19% (95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.03%, 0.35%), 0.13% (95% CI: 0.02%, 0.24%), 0.28% (95%
CI: 0.01%, 0.54%) and 0.52% (95% CI: 0.06%, 0.99%), respectively). These effects 
remained generally stable in two-pollutant models. SO2 and NO2 were significantly
associated with an immediate increase in risk of cardiovascular morbidity, but
the effects on respiratory morbidity were relatively more delayed. The stratified
analyses suggested that temperature could modify the association between PM2.5
and EACs, humidity and atmospheric pressure could modify the association between 
SO2 and EACs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new evidence that higher concentrations of PM2.5,
PM10, SO2, and NO2 may have transiently acute effects on all-cause morbidity and 
subacute effects on respiratory morbidity. SO2 and NO2 may also have immediate
effects on cardiovascular morbidity. Findings of this study have important
implications for the formation of hourly air quality standards.

NPs may be more specific as therapeutic choices in patients with HF. On the other
hand, NEP Inhibitors (NEPIs) combined with RAAS inhibitors have proved to exert
beneficial effects and reduce adverse events in patients with HF. Highly

    Lancet. 2019 Oct 5;394(10205):1210-1212.

BACKGROUND: Guideline-recommended doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and β blockers are similar
for men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even
though there are known sex differences in pharmacokinetics of these drugs. We
hypothesised that there might be sex differences in the optimal dose of ACE
inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers in patients with HFrEF.
METHODS: We did a post-hoc analysis of BIOSTAT-CHF, a prospective study in 11
European countries of patients with heart failure in whom initiation and
up-titration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers was encouraged by protocol.
We included only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, 
and excluded those who died within the first 3 months. Primary outcome was a
composite of time to all-cause mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure.
Findings were validated in ASIAN-HF, an independent cohort of 3539 men and 961
women with HFrEF.
FINDINGS: Among 1308 men and 402 women with HFrEF from BIOSTAT-CHF, women were
older (74 [12] years vs 70 [12] years, p<0·0001) and had lower bodyweights (72
[16] kg vs 85 [18] kg, p<0·0001) and heights (162 [7] cm vs 174 [8] cm, p<0·0001)
than did men, although body-mass index did not differ significantly. A similar
number of men and women reached guideline-recommended target doses of ACE
inhibitors or ARBs (99 [25%] vs 304 [23%], p=0·61) and β blockers (57 [14%] vs
168 [13%], p=0·54). In men, the lowest hazards of death or hospitalisation for
heart failure occurred at 100% of the recommended dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs 
and β blockers, but women showed approximately 30% lower risk at only 50% of the 
recommended doses, with no further decrease in risk at higher dose levels. These 
sex differences were still present after adjusting for clinical covariates,
including age and body surface area. In the ASIAN-HF registry, similar patterns
were observed for both ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers, with women having
approximately 30% lower risk at 50% of the recommended doses, with no further
benefit at higher dose levels.
INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that women with HFrEF might need lower doses 
of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers than men, and brings into question what 
the true optimal medical therapy is for women versus men.

knockout mice, providing an alternative to cumbersome and time-consuming
traditional embryonic stem cell-based methods. An earlier study reported up to
16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout (cKO or floxed) alleles by
microinjection of 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded
oligonucleotides as donors (referred herein as ""two-donor floxing"" method).
RESULTS: We re-evaluate the two-donor method from a consortium of 20 laboratories
across the world. The dataset constitutes 56 genetic loci, 17,887 zygotes, and
1718 live-born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice contain cKO alleles. We
subject the dataset to statistical analyses and a machine learning algorithm,
which reveals that none of the factors analyzed was predictive for the success of
this method. We test some of the newer methods that use one-donor DNA on 18 loci 
for which the two-donor approach failed to produce cKO alleles. We find that the 
one-donor methods are 10- to 20-fold more efficient than the two-donor approach.
CONCLUSION: We propose that the two-donor method lacks efficiency because it
relies on two simultaneous recombination events in cis, an outcome that is
dwarfed by pervasive accompanying undesired editing events. The methods that use 
one-donor DNA are fairly efficient as they rely on only one recombination event, 
and the probability of correct insertion of the donor cassette without
unanticipated mutational events is much higher. Therefore, one-donor methods
offer higher efficiencies for the routine generation of cKO animal models.",Captcha,NaN

applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of
the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and
functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be challenging 
due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of
the clinical data. To achieve this goal, an initial set of training data is
generally needed for constructing priors or for training. Furthermore, it is
difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to
differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents
the methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the
submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in
conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provided 120 three-dimensional
cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes, all 
acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT 
data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been 
evaluated. The results showed that the performance of CT WHS was generally better
than that of MRI WHS. The segmentation of the substructures for different
categories of patients could present different levels of challenge due to the
difference in imaging and variations of heart shapes. The deep learning
(DL)-based methods demonstrated great potential, though several of them reported 
poor results in the blinded evaluation. Their performance could vary greatly
across different network structures and training strategies. The conventional
algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated good
performance, though the accuracy and computational efficiency could be limited.
The challenge, including provision of the annotated training data and the blinded
evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as an ongoing

disease cohorts for investigative studies aimed at developing better diagnoses
and treatments. Recent advances in unsupervised machine learning on electronic
health record (EHR) data have enabled researchers to discover phenotypes without 
input from domain experts. However, most existing studies have ignored time and
modeled diseases as discrete events. Uncovering the evolution of phenotypes - how
they emerge, evolve and contribute to health outcomes - is essential to define
more precise phenotypes and refine the understanding of disease progression. Our 
objective was to assess the benefits of an unsupervised approach that
incorporates time to model diseases as dynamic processes in phenotype discovery.
METHODS: In this study, we applied a constrained non-negative
tensor-factorization approach to characterize the complexity of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) patient cohort based on longitudinal EHR data. Through
tensor-factorization, we identified a set of phenotypic topics (i.e.,
subphenotypes) that these patients established over the 10 years prior to the
diagnosis of CVD, and showed the progress pattern. For each identified
subphenotype, we examined its association with the risk for adverse
cardiovascular outcomes estimated by the American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association Pooled Cohort Risk Equations, a conventional CVD-risk
assessment tool frequently used in clinical practice. Furthermore, we compared
the subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) rates among the six most prevalent
subphenotypes using survival analysis.
RESULTS: From a cohort of 12,380 adult CVD individuals with 1068 unique PheCodes,
we successfully identified 14 subphenotypes. Through the association analysis
with estimated CVD risk for each subtype, we found some phenotypic topics such as
Vitamin D deficiency and depression, Urinary infections cannot be explained by
the conventional risk factors. Through a survival analysis, we found markedly
different risks of subsequent MI following the diagnosis of CVD among the six
most prevalent topics (p < 0.0001), indicating these topics may capture
clinically meaningful subphenotypes of CVD.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential benefits of using
tensor-decomposition to model diseases as dynamic processes from longitudinal EHR
data. Our results suggest that this data-driven approach may potentially help
researchers identify complex and chronic disease subphenotypes in precision
medicine research.

microstructure near the alveolar level. It has been suggested that x-ray
phase-contrast enhanced imaging reveals information about the air volume of the
lung; however, the image texture information in these images remains
underutilized. Projection images of in vivo mouse lungs were acquired via a
tabletop, propagation-based, X-ray phase-contrast imaging system. Anesthetized
mice were mechanically ventilated in an upright position. Consistent with
previously published studies, a distinct image texture was observed uniquely
within lung regions. Lung regions were automatically identified using supervised 
machine learning applied to summary measures of the image texture data. It was
found that an unsupervised clustering within predefined lung regions colocates
with expected differences in anatomy along the cranial-caudal axis in upright
mice. It was also found that specifically selected inflation pressures-here, a
purposeful surrogate of distinct states of mechanical expansion-can be predicted 
from the lung image texture alone, that the prediction model itself varies from
apex to base and that prediction is accurate regardless of overlap with
nonpulmonary structures such as the ribs, mediastinum, and heart.
Cross-validation analysis indicated low inter-animal variation in the image
texture classifications. Together, these results suggest that the image texture
observed in a single X-ray phase-contrast-enhanced projection image could be used
across a range of pressure states to study regional variations in regional lung
function.

fat attenuation index (FAI) and hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions.
METHODS: Patients with stable angina who underwent coronary computed tomography
(CT) angiography and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement within
2 weeks were retrospectively included. Lesion-based perivascular FAI, high-risk
plaque features, total plaque volume (TPV), machine learning-based FFRCT, and
other parameters were recorded. Lesions with invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 were considered
functionally significant.
RESULTS: This study included 167 patients with 219 lesions. Diameter stenosis
(DS), lesion length, TPV, and perivascular FAI were significantly larger or
longer in the group of hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤ 0.8). In
addition, smaller FFRCT value was associated with functionally significant
lesions (0.720 ± 0.11 vs 0.846 ± 0.10, p < 0.001). No significant difference was 
found between the hemodynamically significant and insignificant subgroups with
respect to CT-derived high-risk plaque features. According to multivariate
analysis, DS, TPV, and perivascular FAI were significant predictors of
lesion-specific ischemia. When integrating DS, TPV, and perivascular FAI, the
area under the curve (AUC) of this combined method was 0.821, which was similar
to that of FFRCT (AUC, 0.821 vs 0.850; p = 0.426). The diagnostic accuracy of
FFRCT was higher than that of the combined approach, but the difference was
statistically insignificant (79.0% vs 74.0%, p = 0.093).
CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular FAI was significantly higher for flow-limiting lesions 
than for non-flow-limiting lesions. The combined use of FAI, TPV, and DS could
predict ischemic coronary stenosis with high diagnostic accuracy.

METHODS: We first tested ten traditional machine learning algorithms, and then
the three-best performing algorithms (three types of SVM) were used in the rest
of the study. To improve the performance of these algorithms, a data
preprocessing with normalization was carried out. Moreover, a genetic algorithm
and particle swarm optimization, coupled with stratified 10-fold
cross-validation, were used twice: for optimization of classifier parameters and 
for parallel selection of features.
RESULTS: The presented approach enhanced the performance of all traditional
machine learning algorithms used in this study. We also introduced a new
optimization technique called N2Genetic optimizer (a new genetic training). Our
experiments demonstrated that N2Genetic-nuSVM provided the accuracy of 93.08% and
F1-score of 91.51% when predicting CAD outcomes among the patients included in a 
well-known Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. These results are competitive and comparable 
to the best results in the field.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that machine-learning techniques optimized by the proposed
approach, can lead to highly accurate models intended for both clinical and
research use.

OBJECTIVE: Mixtures of temporally nonstationary signals are very common in
biomedical applications. The nonstationarity of the source signals can be used as
a discriminative property for signal separation. Herein, a semi-blind source
separation algorithm is proposed for the extraction of temporally nonstationary
components from linear multichannel mixtures of signals and noises.
METHODS: A hypothesis test is proposed for the detection and fusion of temporally
nonstationary events, by using ad hoc indexes for monitoring the first and second
order statistics of the innovation process. As proof of concept, the general
framework is customized and tested over noninvasive fetal cardiac recordings
acquired from the maternal abdomen, over publicly available datasets, using two
types of nonstationarity detectors: 1) a local power variations detector, and 2) 
a modeldeviations detector using the innovation process properties of an extended
Kalman filter.
RESULTS: The performance of the proposed method is assessed in presence of white 
and colored noise, in different signal-to-noise ratios.

ratios (GMRs) of urinary ΣAs for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in
reported food group consumption. Exploratory analyses were stratified by gender
and study center.
RESULTS: In fully adjusted generalized estimating equation models, the percent
increase (95% confidence interval) of urinary ΣAs per increase in reported food
consumption corresponding to the IQR was 13% (5%, 21%) for organ meat, 8% (4%,
13%) for rice, 7% (2%, 13%) for processed meat, and 4% (1%, 7%) for non-alcoholic
drinks. In analyses stratified by study center, the association with organ meat
was only observed in North/South Dakota. Consumption of red meat [percent
increase -7% (-11%, -3%)] and fries and chips [-6% (-10%, -2%)] was inversely
associated with urinary ΣAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Organ meat, processed meat, rice, and non-alcoholic drinks
contribute to ΣAs exposure in the SHFS population. Organ meat is a unique source 
of ΣAs exposure for North and South Dakota participants and may reflect local
food consumption. Further studies should comprehensively evaluate drinking water 
arsenic in SHFS communities and determine the relative contribution of diet and
drinking water to total arsenic exposure.

medications warranted phase 4 clinical trials to demonstrate CVD safety of newly 
marketed anti-diabetic drugs. Although initially designed to evaluate safety,
some of these CVD outcome trials (CVOTs) have in fact shown CVD benefits. New
medication classes, like glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues and
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have shown reductions in the 
risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including, myocardial
infarction, stroke, CV death, and heart failure (HF). Perhaps more importantly,
SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated reduction in the risk of HF hospitalizations, being
the first class of anti-diabetic drugs to do so. Conversely, dipeptidyl peptidase
4 (DPP-4) inhibitors did not significantly affect atherosclerotic CVD end-points 
and some actually increased the risk of HF hospitalizations. Further, the
adverse/beneficial CVD effects of these medications may not be class specific.
This review focuses on the main results of these CVOTs while highlighting the
heterogeneity of CVD end-points within each class and discusses important
mechanistic insights and adverse effect profiles.

use esophagectomy alone or neoadjuvant therapy in surgical care for individual
patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric
junction-information not available from randomized trials-a machine-learning
analysis was performed using worldwide real-world data on patients undergoing
different therapies for this rare adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Using random forest technology in a sequential analysis, we (1)
identified eligibility for each of four therapies among 13,365 patients:
esophagectomy alone (n = 6649), neoadjuvant therapy (n = 4706), esophagectomy and
adjuvant therapy (n = 998), and neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy (n = 1022); (2) 
performed survival analyses incorporating interactions of patient and cancer
characteristics with therapy; (3) determined optimal therapy as that predicted to
maximize lifetime within 10 years (restricted mean survival time; RMST) for each 
patient; and (4) compared lifetime gained from optimal versus actual therapies.
RESULTS: Actual therapy was optimal in 61% of those receiving esophagectomy
alone; neoadjuvant therapy was optimal for 36% receiving neoadjuvant therapy.
Many patients were predicted to benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapy.
Total RMST for actual therapy received was 58,825 years. Had patients received
optimal therapy, total RMST was predicted to be 62,982 years, a 7% gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Average treatment effect for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus yields 
only crude evidence-based therapy guidelines. However, patient response to
therapy is widely variable, and survival after data-driven predicted optimal
therapy often differs from actual therapy received. Therapy must address an
individual patient's cancer and clinical characteristics to provide precision
surgical therapy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric
junction.

used to examine candidate molecules during the drug discovery process. Data
mining and machine learning are effective tools in leveraging the drug datasets.
OBJECTIVE: Developed model in this study can be used as a simple filter in drug
modelling to eliminate potentially inappropriate molecules in the early stages.
In this work we developed a Drug Decision Support System (DDSS), in which these
tools are used to induce classification models, association rules and subgraph
patterns. DDSS helps drug designers to develop a successful drug candidate.
METHODS: Molecular descriptors that are effective in classification models were
identified for determination of a number of rules in drug molecules. They are
derived using ADRIANA.Code program and Lipinski&#039;s rule of five. Closed
frequent molecular structures in the form of subgraph fragments were also
obtained with Gaston algorithm. Gaston algorithm, included in ParMol Package
(Parallel Molecular Mining) was used to find common molecular fragments in the
drug datasets. WEKA machine learning tool version 3.6.11 and MATLAB software
package (MATLAB & SIMULINK, R2015a) were used as tools for this study.
RESULTS: We observed that TPSA, XlogP Natoms, HDon_O and TPSA are the most
distinctive features in the pool of the molecular descriptors. Cardiac therapy,
anti-epileptics and anti-parkinson drugs with approved and withdrawn drugs are
identified and related databases are screened to obtain datasets for
experimentation.
CONCLUSION: The experimental evaluation shows that the system is promising at
determination of potential drug molecules to classify drug molecules correctly
according to the types of diseases.

effects of contraceptives on HIV-1 risk. Some observational studies suggest there
may be an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among women using the long-acting

potential mechanism of this susceptibility is unclear. There are few data on the

fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC). In this research area, the
computerized systems are usually utilized to provide more objective and
repeatable results.
Materials and Methods: Feature selection algorithms are of great importance
regarding the computerized systems to not only reduce the dimension of feature
set but also to reveal the most relevant features without losing too much
information. In this paper, three filters and two wrappers feature selection
methods and machine learning models, which are artificial neural network (ANN),
k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM),
are evaluated on a high dimensional feature set obtained from an open-access
CTU-UHB intrapartum CTG database. The signals are divided into two classes as
normal and hypoxic considering umbilical artery pH value (pH < 7.20) measured
after delivery. A comprehensive diagnostic feature set forming the features
obtained from morphological, linear, nonlinear, time-frequency and image-based
time-frequency domains is generated first. Then, combinations of the feature
selection algorithms and machine learning models are evaluated to achieve the
most effective features as well as high classification performance.
Results: The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve better
classification performance using lower dimensional feature set that comprises of 
more related features, instead of the high-dimensional feature set. The most
informative feature subset was generated by considering the frequency of
selection of the features by feature selection algorithms. As a result, the most 
efficient results were produced by selected only 12 relevant features instead of 
a full feature set consisting of 30 diagnostic indices and SVM model. Sensitivity
and specificity were achieved as 77.40% and 93.86%, respectively.

unit group design method: control group, Ee group and Ee plus Ber group (low: 50 
mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), medium: 100 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) and high dose: 150 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), 
n=8 each). Ber (1.5 ml) or equal volume saline was given per gavage for 14 days. 
Rats assigned to Ee groups underwent Ee swimming once daily and rats in control
group remain sedentary. After 14 days, echocardiographic measurements were
performed and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening
(LVFS), left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVIDd) and left ventricular systolic
diameter (LVIDs) were obtained. The morphological structure of heart was detected
by HE and Masson staining. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde

apoptosis was detected by TUNEL method. The protein expression of myocardial
hypertrophy marker protein B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and apoptotic marker 
protein (Bcl-2, Bax) in rat myocardial tissue was detected by Western blot.
Results: (1) Both LVFS and LVEF were significantly lower, and LVIDs and LVIDd
were significantly larger in Ee group than those in control group (all P<0.01).
The LVFS and LVEF in medium dose of Ber and high-dose Ber groups were
significantly higher, and the LVIDs and LVIDd were significantly smaller than
those in Ee group (all P<0.01). (2) The results of HE staining showed that the
myocardial cells in control group were closely arranged, regular, normal in
morphology, clear in structure, and uniform in staining. The myocardial cells of 
rats in Ee group were disarranged, cell staining was uneven, and vacuoles
appeared in the cytoplasm. The disorder of myocardial cell arrangement and
unequal staining in the medium dose of Ber were attenuated than in Ee group. The 
Masson staining results showed that the myocardial cells in control group were
closely arranged, regular, normal in shape, clear in structure, and rarely
blue-stained (fibrosis). Myocardial cells in rats in Ee group showed obvious
fibrosis. The myocardial cell fibrosis in rats with medium dose of Ber was
significantly reduced than exercise group. (3) MDA content in myocardial tissue
of rats in Ee group was significantly higher than that of control group, and MDA 
content in myocardial tissue of rats in medium dose of Ber group was
significantly lower than in Ee group (P<0.01). The SOD activity of myocardial
tissue in rats was significantly lower than that of control group, while that of 
rats with medium dose of Ber was significantly higher than that of rats in Ee
group (P<0.01). (4) TUNEL staining results showed that only a small amount of
apoptosis myocardial cells were seen in control group, and a large number of
apoptosis myocardial cells were seen in rats in Ee group. However, the number of 
apoptotic cardiomyocytes in medium dose of Ber was significantly lower than that 
in Ee group. The AI of rat cardiomyocytes was significantly higher than that of
control group (P<0.01), and the AI of rat cardiomyocytes in median dose of Ber
group was significantly lower than in Ee group (P<0.01). (5) BNP and Bax protein 
expression in the myocardial tissues of rats in Ee group were significantly
higher than in control group (P<0.01). BNP and Bax protein expression in the
myocardial tissues in median dose of Ber group were significantly lower than that
of Ee group (P<0.01). The myocardial protein expression level of Bax was
significantly higher, and the myocardial protein level of Bcl-2 was significantly
lower in Ee group than in control group (both P<0.01), treatment with median dose
of Ber could partly reverse above changes (both P<0.01). Conclusion: Ber can
attenuate exhaustion exercise induced myocardial injury and remodeling in rats,
and the beneficial effects of Ber might possibly be mediated by reducing free
radical release and cardiomyocytes apoptosis.

characteristics and influence factors of aortic insufficiency (AI) patients with 
myocardial fibrosis. Method: This retrospective study included 59 AI patients who
received CMR and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations from June 2011
to February 2015. AI patients were divided into 2 groups: bicuspid aortic valve
(BAV) group (n=30) and non-BAV group (n=29). Patients were also divided into late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) group (n=27) and non-LGE group (n=32). The baseline 
clinical characteristics were collected through electronic medical records.
Hemodynamic parameters such as grade of AI, cardiac functional parameters and LGE
mass fraction (LGE%) were measured by CMR post-processing analysis. Kappa test
was used to assess the consistency of AI severity between CMR and TTE, and the
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate influence
factors of myocardial fibrosis in AI patients. Results: (1) 56 (94.9%) patients
were male, and the mean age was (44.2±11.0) years old. There was no significant
difference in age and gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcoholic consumption
between BAV and non-BAV group (all P>0.05). There were a higher proportion of
smoking history (P=0.008), a lower body mass index (BMI) (P=0.020) in the LGE
group than in the non-LGE group. (2) The accuracy of CMR in diagnosis of BAV was 
96.7% (29/30) compared to the gold standard. In the BAV group, 20 patients
(66.7%) were with fusion of left and right cusp (L-R), 5 patients (16.7%) were
with fusion of right and noncoronary cusp (R-N), 5 patients (16.7%) were with
fusion of left and noncoronary cusp (L-N); patients with BAV had larger left
ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), left ventricular end systolic
volume index (LVESVi), higher proportion of LGE and lower left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) than those in non-BAV group (all P<0.05). There were 19 
patients with BAV in the LGE group, the cases of L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (52.6%), 5
(26.3%), and 4 (21.1%), respectively. In the non-LGE group, patients with BAV of 
L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (90.9%), 0, and 1 (9.1%), respectively. Patients with LGE
had lower body surface area (BSA), LVEF and larger LVEDVi, LVESVi, left
ventricular mass index (LVMi) and higher proportion of BAV compared patients
without LGE. In addition, the proportion of moderate and severe AI patients was
significantly higher in BAV group than in non-BAV group (P=0.009). (3) The
consistency of CMR and TTE in evaluating the severity of AI patients: the
agreement between TTE and CMR regarding AI severity was satisfactory (kappa value
was 0.624, 95%CI 0.402-0.831, P<0.001). (4) The linear regression analysis
demonstrated a negative correlation between LVEF and LGE% in BAV and non-BAV
group (P<0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the
presence of BAV was an independent risk factor of left ventricucar fibrosis
(OR=5.050, 95%CI 1.220-20.908, P=0.025) after adjustment for LVEF, hypertension, 
LVEDVi and LVMi. Conclusion: Multi-parametric CMR provides a satisfactory
noninvasive tool for estimation of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling
in patients with AI, and BAV is an independent risk factor for myocardial
fibrosis in patients with AI.

P-selectin-dependent platelet aggregation. Here, we demonstrated that
P-selectin-mediated platelet aggregation on a collagen-coated surface under flow 
indeed depended on sulfatides and that this interaction differed considerably
from the interaction of P-selectin with P-selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1
(PSGL-1), which underlies leukocyte-endothelium adhesion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Upon platelet activation, sulfatides were translocated to
the platelet surface to form focal hot-spots. Interestingly, P-selectin was
observed to exclusively interact with liposomes with a sulfatide density higher
than 21% (w/w), indicating that the binding profile of P-selectin for
sulfatide-rich liposomes was dependent on sulfatide density. Sulfatide-liposome
binding to P-selectin and sulfatide/P-selectin-dependent platelet aggregation was
blunted by peptide antagonists, carrying the EWVDV motif within N-terminal
extensions, such as CDVEWVDVSC (half maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 = 0.2 
μM), but not by the EWVDV core motif itself (IC50 > 1000 μM), albeit both being
equally potent inhibitors of PSGL-1/P-selectin interaction (IC50= 7-12 μM).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the sulfatide/P-selectin interaction
implicates multiple binding pockets, which only partly overlap with that of
PSGL-1. These observations open ways to selectively interfere with
sulfatide/P-selectin-dependent platelet aggregation without affecting
PSGL-1-dependent cell adhesion.",Captcha,NaN

regeneration biology, providing further mechanistic insights and possible
therapeutic applications. The original discovery by Yamanaka and co-workers
showed that the expression of four transcription factors in fibroblasts resulted 
in the generation of iPSCs that can be differentiated into various cell types.
This technology should be particularly useful for restoring cells with limited
proliferative capacities such as adult heart muscle cells and neurons, in order
to treat diseases affecting these cell types. More recently, iPSCs-mediated cell 
reprogramming has advanced to new technologies including direct reprogramming and
pharmacological reprogramming. Direct reprogramming allows for the conversion of 
fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes, neurons or other cells by expressing multiple
cell type-specific transcription factors without going through the production of 
iPSCs. Both iPSC-mediated reprogramming as well as direct reprogramming can also 
be promoted by a combination of small molecules, opening up a possibility for
pharmacological therapies to induce cell reprogramming. However, all of these
processes have been shown to be affected by reactive oxygen species that reduce
the efficacies of reprogramming fibroblasts into iPSCs, differentiating iPSCs
into target cells, as well as direct reprogramming. Accordingly, antioxidants
have been shown to support these reprogramming processes and this review article 
summarizes these findings. It should be noted however, that the actions of
antioxidants to support cell reprogramming may be through their ROS inhibiting
abilities, but could also be due to mechanisms that are independent of classical 
antioxidant actions.",Captcha,NaN

clinically comparable wearable devices. Telemedicine and remote diagnosis could
harness the capability of mobile cardiac health information, as the technology on
bio-physical signal monitoring has improved significantly.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review article is (1) to systematically assess
the viability of ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG), (2) to provide a systems
level understanding of a broad spectrum of wearable heart signal monitoring
approaches and (3) to identify areas of improvement in the existing technology
needed to attain clinical grade diagnosis.
RESULTS: Based on the included literature, we have identified (1) that the
developments in ECG monitoring through wearable devices are reaching feasibility,
and are capable of delivering diagnostic and prognostic information, (2) that
reliable sensing is the major bottleneck in the entire process of ambulatory
monitoring, (3) that there is a strong need for artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques to parse and infer the biosignals and (4) that
aspects of wearer comfort has largely been ignored in the prevailing
developments, which can become a key factor for consumer acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac health information is crucial for diagnosis and prevention
of several disease onsets. Mobile and continuous monitoring can aid avoiding
risks involved with acute symptoms. The health information obtained through
continuous monitoring can serve as the BigData of heart signals, and can
facilitate new treatment methods and devise effective health policies.

research. However, the number of lung cancer PDX is limited. In the present
study, we successfully established 10 PDX, including three adenocarcinoma (AD),
six squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) and one large cell carcinoma (LA), from 30
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (18 AD, 10 SQ, and 2 LA), mainly
in SCID hairless outbred (SHO) mice (Crlj:SHO-Prkdcscid Hrhr ). Histology of SQ, 
advanced clinical stage (III-IV), status of lymph node metastasis (N2-3), and
maximum standardized uptake value ≥10 when evaluated using a delayed 18
F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan was
associated with successful PDX establishment. Histological analyses showed that
PDX had histology similar to that of patients' surgically resected tumors (SRT), 
whereas components of the microenvironment were replaced with murine cells after 
several passages. Next-generation sequencing analyses showed that after two to
six passages, PDX preserved the majority of the somatic mutations and mRNA
expressions of the corresponding SRT. Two out of three PDX with AD histology had 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletion) and
were sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), such as gefitinib
and osimertinib. Furthermore, in one of the two PDX with an EGFR mutation,
osimertinib resistance was induced that was associated with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This study presented 10 serially
transplantable PDX of NSCLC in SHO mice and showed the use of PDX with an EGFR
mutation for analyses of EGFR-TKI resistance.

is impaired in ciliary dyskinesia. The objective of this study was to evaluate
the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and its characteristics in
bronchiectasis patients suspected of harboring ciliary dyskinesia.
METHODS: Bronchiectasis patients referred to a rhinology clinic for nasal brush
biopsy (NBB) were included in this study. NBB was performed using a curettage
technique whereby ciliated epithelial cells were obtained from the surface of the
inferior nasal turbinate. Results of transmission electron microscopy findings,
primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) gene (35 genes) analyses (Invitae), and sinus
computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (age, 54 ± 2.9 years) were referred for NBB
between 2015 and 2018. Thirteen patients (56.5%) met the criteria for diagnosis
of CRS. Nineteen patients had ciliary ultrastructural defects. The most common
finding was compound cilia (n = 11, 47.8%). Five patients (21.7%) had central
microtubule defects (CMD) with higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 
) at the time of referral than those without CMD (CMD+ , 91 ± 3.7%; CMD- , 73.5 ±
5.7%; p = 0.023). Of 15 subjects with a PCD gene panel, 67% (9 of 15) carried at 
least 1 gene associated with PCD. Only 1 patient reached diagnosis of PCD.
Approximately 50% of non-PCD carriers had a smoking history (p < 0.05).
Lund-Mackay scores did not significantly differ between PCD and non-PCD carriers 
(p = 0.72).
CONCLUSION: Nearly half of bronchiectasis patients referred for NBB had
concurrent CRS. The presence of ciliary abnormalities was not amplified in
bronchiectasis patients with CRS compared to those without CRS. Extrinsic factors
may be related to ciliary structural abnormalities in non-PCD gene carriers.

cancer patients who must choose between radical prostatectomy (RP) and external
beam radiotherapy (RT). Because the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a
measurable factor that affects survival events, this research seeks to validate
the potential of the CCI to improve the accuracy of various prediction models.
Thus, we employed the Cox proportional hazard model and machine learning methods,
including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to model the data 
of medical records in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). In
total, 8581 individuals were enrolled, of whom 4879 had received RP and 3702 had 
received RT. Patients in the RT group were older and exhibited higher CCI scores 
and higher incidences of some CCI items. Moderate-to-severe liver disease,
dementia, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and
cerebrovascular disease all increase the risk of overall death in the Cox hazard 
model. The CCI-reinforced SVM and RF models are 85.18% and 81.76% accurate,
respectively, whereas the SVM and RF models without the use of the CCI are
relatively less accurate, at 75.81% and 74.83%, respectively. Therefore, CCI and 
some of its items are useful predictors of overall and prostate-cancer-specific
survival and could constitute valuable features for machine-learning modeling.",Captcha,NaN

ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study is aimed at investigating whether
SUMOylation of Drp1 is involved in the protection of zinc ion on cardiac I/R
injury.
Methods: Mouse hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of regional ischemia followed 
by 2 hours of reperfusion (ischemia/reoxygenation (I/R)). Infarct size and
apoptosis were assessed. HL-1 cells were subjected to 24 hours of hypoxia and 6
hours of reoxygenation (hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)). Zinc was given 5 min before
reperfusion for 30 min. SENP2 overexpression plasmid (Flag-SENP2), Drp1 mutation 
plasmid (Myc-Drp1 4KR), and SUMO1 siRNA were transfected into HL-1 cells for 48 h
before hypoxia. Effects of zinc on SUMO family members were analyzed by Western
blotting. SUMOylation of Drp1, apoptosis and the collapse of mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm), and mitophagy were evaluated.
Results: Compared with the control, SUMO1 modification level of proteins in the
H/R decreased, while this effect was reversed by zinc. In the setting of H/R,
zinc attenuated myocardial apoptosis, which was reversed by SUMO1 siRNA. Similar 
effects were observed in SUMO1 KO mice exposed to H/R. In addition, the
dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a target protein of SUMO1. The SUMOylation of
Drp1 induced by zinc regulated mitophagy and contributed to the protective effect
of zinc on H/R injury.
Conclusions: SUMOylation of Drp1 played an essential role in zinc-induced cardio 
protection against I/R injury. Our findings provide a promising therapeutic
approach for acute myocardial I/R injury.",Captcha,NaN

(inflammation of the blood vessels) that mainly affects children between six
months and five years of age. The vasculitis primarily impacts medium-sized blood
vessels, especially in the coronary arteries. In most children, intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy rapidly reduce inflammatory markers,
fever, and other clinical symptoms. However, approximately 15% to 20% of children
receiving the initial IVIG infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are
classified as IVIG-resistant. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is an
inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in host defence against
infections and in immune responses. Several studies have established that
blocking TNF-α is critical for obtaining anti-inflammatory effects in children
with KD, thus, there is a need to identify benefits and risks of TNF-α blockers
for the treatment of KD.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using TNF-α blockers (i.e.
infliximab and etanercept) to treat children with Kawasaki disease.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the
Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL
databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry
Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 19 September 2018. We also
undertook reference checking of grey literature.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared
TNF-α blockers (i.e. infliximab and etanercept) to placebo or other drugs
(including retreatment with IVIG) in children with KD, reported in abstract or
full-text.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied the study 
selection criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. When necessary, we 
contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the
certainty of the evidence.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials from 14 reports, with a total of 494
participants. All included trials were individual RCTs that examined the effect
of TNF-α blockers for KD.Five trials (with 494 participants) reported the
incidence of treatment resistance. TNF-α blockers reduced the incidence of
treatment resistance (TNF-α blocker intervention group 30/237, control group
58/257; risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.86;
low-certainty evidence).Four trials reported the incidence of coronary artery
abnormalities (CAAs). Three trials (with 270 participants) contributed data to
the meta-analysis, since we could not get the data needed for the analysis from
the fourth trial. There was no clear difference between groups in the incidence
of CAAs (TNF-α blocker intervention group 8/125, control group 9/145; RR 1.18,
95% CI 0.45 to 3.12; low-certainty evidence).Three trials with 250 participants
reported the adverse effect 'infusion reactions' after treatment initiation. The 
TNF-α blocker intervention decreased infusion reactions (TNF-α blocker
intervention group 0/126, control group 15/124; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45;
low-certainty evidence).Two trials with 227 participants reported the adverse
effect 'infections' after treatment initiation. There was no clear difference
between groups (TNF-α blocker intervention group 7/114, control group 10/113; RR 
0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.37; low-certainty evidence).One trial (with 31
participants) reported the adverse effect 'cutaneous reactions' (rash and contact
dermatitis). There was no clear difference between the groups for incidence of

0.24 to 90.69; very low-certainty evidence) or for incidence of contact
dermatitis (TNF-α blocker intervention group 1/16, control group 3/15; RR 0.31,

adverse effects such as injection site reactions, neutropenia, infections,
demyelinating disease, heart failure, malignancy, and induction of autoimmunity.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found a limited number of RCTs examining the effect of
TNF-α blockers for KD. In summary, low-certainty evidence indicates that TNF-α
blockers have beneficial effects on treatment resistance and the adverse effect
'infusion reaction' after treatment initiation for KD when compared with no
treatment or additional treatment with IVIG. Further research will add to the
evidence base. Due to the small number of underpowered trials contributing to the
analyses, the results presented should be treated with caution. Further large
high quality trials with timing and type of TNF-α blockers used are needed to
determine the effects of TNF-α blockers for KD.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31425625.pdf

rebubbling after Descemet's endothelial membrane keratoplasty (DMEK).
METHODS: This retrospective study included eyes that underwent rebubbling after
DMEK (rebubbling group: RB group) and the same number of eyes that did not
require rebubbling (non-RB group), based on medical records. To classify the RB
group, randomly selected images from anterior segment optical coherence
tomography at postoperative day 5 were evaluated by corneal specialists. The
criterion for rebubbling was the condition where graft detachment reached the
central 4.0-mm pupil area. We trained nine types of deep neural network
structures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception,
DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201) and built nine models. Using each
model, we tested the validation data and evaluated the model.
RESULTS: This study included 496 images (31 eyes from 24 patients) in the RB
group and 496 images (31 eyes from 29 patients) in the non-RB group. Because 16
picture images were obtained from the same point of each eye, a total of 992
images were obtained. The VGG19 model was found to have the highest area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of all models. The AUC,
sensitivity, and specificity of the VGG19 model were 0.964, 0.967, and 0.915,

High-risk prediction of cardiovascular disease is of great significance and
impendency in medical fields with the increasing phenomenon of sub-health these
years. Most existing pathological methods for the prognosis prediction are either
costly or prone to misjudgement. Therefore, plenty of automated models based on
machine learning have been proposed to predict the onset of cardiovascular
disease with the premorbid information of patients extracted from their
historical Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, it is a tough job to select
proper features from longitudinal and heterogeneous EHRs, and also a great
challenge to obtain accurate and robust representations for patients. In this
paper, we propose an entirely end-to-end model called DeepRisk based on attention
mechanism and deep neural networks, which can not only learn high-quality
features automatically from EHRs, but also efficiently integrate heterogeneous
and time-ordered medical data, and finally predict patients' risk of
cardiovascular diseases. Experiments are carried out on a real medical dataset
and results show that DeepRisk can significantly improve the high-risk prediction
accuracy for cardiovascular disease compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",Captcha,NaN

Space and Shape Learning.

Mansoor A, Cerrolaza J, Perez G, Biggs E, Okada K, Nino G, Linguraru MG.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) techniques for lung field segmentation from chest 
radiographs (CXR) have been proposed for adult cohorts, but rarely for pediatric 
subjects. Statistical shape models (SSMs), the workhorse of most stateof-the-art 
CXR-based lung field segmentation methods, do not efficiently accommodate shape
variation of the lung field during the pediatric developmental stages. The main
contributions of our work are: (1) a generic lung field segmentation framework
from CXR accommodating large shape variation for adult and pediatric cohorts; (2)
a deep representation learning detection mechanism, ensemble space learning, for 
robust object localization; and (3) marginal shape deep learning for the shape
deformation parameter estimation. Unlike the iterative approach of conventional
SSMs, the proposed shape learning mechanism transforms the parameter space into
marginal subspaces that are solvable efficiently using the recursive
representation learning mechanism. Furthermore, our method is the first to
include the challenging retro-cardiac region in the CXR-based lung segmentation
for accurate lung capacity estimation. The framework is evaluated on 668 CXRs of 
patients between 3 month to 89 year of age. We obtain a mean Dice similarity
coefficient of 0.96 ±0.03 (including the retro-cardiac region). For a given
accuracy, the proposed approach is also found to be faster than conventional
SSM-based iterative segmentation methods. The computational simplicity of the
proposed generic framework could be similarly applied to the fast segmentation of
other deformable objects.",Captcha,NaN

predominantly affects women during middle-life, with features that include
stenosis, aneurysm, and dissection of medium-large arteries. Recently, plasma
proteomics has emerged as an important means to understand cardiovascular
diseases. Our objectives were: (i) to characterize plasma proteins and determine 
if any exhibit differential abundance in FMD subjects vs. matched healthy
controls and (ii) to leverage these protein data to conduct systems analyses to
provide biologic insights on FMD, and explore if this could be developed into a
blood-based FMD test.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Females with 'multifocal' FMD and matched healthy controls
underwent clinical phenotyping, dermal biopsy, and blood draw. Using dual-capture
proximity extension assay and nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy, we
evaluated plasma levels of 981 proteins and 31 lipid sub-classes, respectively.
In a discovery cohort (Ncases = 90, Ncontrols = 100), we identified 105 proteins 
and 16 lipid sub-classes (predominantly triglycerides and fatty acids) with
differential plasma abundance in FMD cases vs. controls. In an independent cohort
(Ncases = 23, Ncontrols = 28), we successfully validated 37 plasma proteins and
10 lipid sub-classes with differential abundance. Among these, 5/37 proteins
exhibited genetic control and Bayesian analyses identified 3 of these as
potential upstream drivers of FMD. In a 3rd cohort (Ncases = 506,
Ncontrols = 876) the genetic locus of one of these upstream disease drivers,
CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), was independently validated as being associated
with risk of having FMD (odds ratios  = 1.36; P = 0.0003). Immune-fluorescence
staining identified that CD2AP is expressed by the endothelium of medium-large
arteries. Finally, machine learning trained on the discovery cohort was used to
develop a test for FMD. When independently applied to the validation cohort, the 
test showed a c-statistic of 0.73 and sensitivity of 78.3%.
CONCLUSION: FMD exhibits a plasma proteogenomic and lipid signature that includes
potential causative disease drivers, and which holds promise for developing a
blood-based test for this disease.

interlesion distance using standard power settings for the treatment of atrial
fibrillation (AF). The purpose was to compare the safety and efficacy of a
conventional CLOSE and a higher power shorter duration (HPSD)-CLOSE pulmonary
vein isolation (PVI) strategy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: All consecutive patients referred for PVI were included
after informed consent was obtained from them. Group 1 was treated with a
standard CLOSE protocol and group 2 with a HPSD-CLOSE protocol (45 W anterior and
35 W posterior). Procedural parameters and 6-month follow-up were analyzed. In
total, 174 patients (group 1: n = 94 [paroxysmal: n = 74]; group 2: n = 80
[paroxysmal: n = 65], similar baseline characteristics) were included. PVI was
reached in all, but procedure duration (82 ± 18 minutes vs 100 ± 22 minutes;
P < .0001) and radiofrequency (RF) time (23 ± 5 minutes vs 36 ± 11 minutes;
P < .0001) was shorter in group 2. First pass isolation was similar in groups 2
and 1 (left veins: 94% vs 90%; P = .42 and right veins: 83% vs 84%; P = .79,
respectively). Six-month off- antiarrhythmic drugs freedom of AF/AT was similar
in groups 2 and 1 (82% [paroxysmal: 86%] vs 83% [paroxysmal: 88%]; P = .93,
respectively). Major complications were similar (group 2: 1% vs group 1: 3%;
P = .39).
CONCLUSION: A higher-power short duration approach can shorten a CLOSE procedure 
and reduce ablation time without having a negative impact on safety or
efficiency.

substantial cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death. The most
common intracoronay complications caused by coronary artery disease are intimal
hyperplasia, calcification, fibrosis, neovascularization and macrophage
accumulation, which require efficient prevention strategies. OCT can provide
discriminative information of the intracoronary tissues, which can be used to
train a robust fully automatic tissue characterization model based on deep
learning. In this study, we aimed to design a diagnostic model of coronary artery
lesions. Particularly, we trained a random forest using convolutional neural
network features to distinguish between normal and diseased arterial wall
structure. Then, based on the arterial wall structure, fully convolutional
network is designed to extract the tissue layers in normal cases, and
pathological tissues regardless of lesion type in pathological cases. Then, the
type of the lesions can be characterized with high precision using our previous
model. The results demonstrate the robustness of the model with the approximate
overall accuracy up to 90%.

readmission and death, especially in the 90 days following discharge. We aimed to
assess the safety and efficacy of early optimization of oral HF therapy with
beta-blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or

METHODS: In a multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study, a total 
of 900 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 'usual care' or
'high-intensity care'. Patients enrolled in the usual care arm will be discharged
and managed according to usual clinical practice at the site. In the
high-intensity care arm, doses of oral HF medications - including a BB, ACEi or
ARB, and MRA - will be up-titrated to 50% of recommended doses before discharge
and to 100% of recommended doses within 2 weeks of discharge. Up-titration will
be delayed if the patients develop worsening symptoms and signs of congestion,
hyperkalaemia, hypotension, bradycardia, worsening of renal function or
significant increase in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide between visits.
The primary endpoint is 90-day all-cause mortality or HF readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: STRONG-HF is the first study to assess whether rapid up-titration of
evidence-based guideline-recommended therapies with close follow-up in a large
cohort of patients discharged from an acute HF admission is safe and can affect
adverse outcomes during the first 90 days after discharge.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive value for short-term disease severity accrual

prognostic factors.
METHODS: Patients with SSc from the EUSTAR database with a disease duration from 
the onset of the first non-Raynaud sign/symptom ≤5 years and a baseline visit
between 2003 and 2014 were first extracted. To capture the disease activity
variations over time, EUSTAR-AI and EScSG-AI adjusted means were calculated. The 
primary outcome was disease progression defined as a Δ≥1 in the Medsger's
severity score and in distinct items at the 2-year follow-up visit. Logistic
regression analysis was carried out to identify predictive factors.
RESULTS: 549 patients were enrolled. At multivariate analysis, the EUSTAR-AI
adjusted mean was the only predictor of any severity accrual and of that of lung 
and heart, skin and peripheral vascular disease over 2 years.
CONCLUSION: The adjusted mean EUSTAR-AI has the best predictive value for disease
progression and development of severe organ involvement over time in SSc.

artery calcium (CAC) score on the diagnostic performance of
machine-learning-based coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography
(cCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR).
BACKGROUND: CT-FFR is used reliably to detect lesion-specific ischemia. Novel
CT-FFR algorithms using machine-learning artificial intelligence techniques
perform fast and require less complex computational fluid dynamics. Yet,
influence of CAC score on diagnostic performance of the machine-learning approach
has not been investigated.
METHODS: Four hundred eighty-two vessels from 314 patients (62.3 ± 9.3 years, 77%
male) who underwent cCTA followed by invasive FFR were investigated from the
MACHINE (Machine Learning based CT Angiography derived FFR: a Multi-center
Registry) registry data. CAC scores were quantified using the Agatston
convention. The diagnostic performance of CT-FFR to detect lesion-specific
ischemia was assessed across all Agatston score categories (CAC 0, >0 to <100,
100 to <400, and ≥400) on a per-vessel level with invasive FFR as the reference
standard.
RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR versus invasive FFR was superior to
cCTA alone on a per-vessel level (78% vs. 60%) and per patient level (83% vs.
73%) across all Agatston score categories. No statistically significant
differences in the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity of CT-FFR
were observed across the categories. CT-FFR showed good discriminatory power in
vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC ≥ 400) and high performance in
low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC >0 to <400) with a statistically
significant difference in the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve (AUC) (AUC: 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57-0.85] vs. 0.85
[95% CI: 0.82-0.89], p = 0.04). CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic value over cCTA
in vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC ≥ 400: AUC 0.71 vs. 0.55, p = 0.04) and
low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC >0 to <400: AUC 0.86 vs. 0.63,
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning-based CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic performance
over cCTA alone in CAC with a significant difference in the performance of CT-FFR
as calcium burden/Agatston calcium score increased. (Machine Learning Based CT

diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), using heart rate (HR) signals obtained from 
electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Recent progress in deep learning has contributed
significantly to improvement in the quality of healthcare. In order for deep
learning models to perform well, large datasets are required for training.
However, a difficulty in the biomedical field is the lack of clinical data with
expert annotation. A recent, commonly implemented technique to train deep
learning models using small datasets is to transfer the weighting, developed from
a large dataset, to the current model. This deep learning transfer strategy is
generally employed for two-dimensional signals. Herein, the weighting of models
pre-trained using two-dimensional large image data was applied to one-dimensional
HR signals. The one-dimensional HR signals were then converted into frequency
spectrum images, which were utilized for application to well-known pre-trained
models, specifically: AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. The DenseNet
pre-trained model yielded the highest classification average accuracy of 97.62%, 
and sensitivity of 100%, to detect DM subjects via HR signal recordings. In the
future, we intend to further test this developed model by utilizing additional
data along with cloud-based storage to diagnose DM via heart signal analysis.

skilled resuscitation team, prompt initiation of high-quality cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and defibrillation, and organisational structures to support IHCA
response. We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher
versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the
American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry,
purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and
risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with 
nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement
staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by
type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and
support for roles.
RESULTS: Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first
responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We
found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for
nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses 
at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with
nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical
practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted
nurses as leaders-administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the
institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical
champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive
nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs.
CONCLUSION: Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and
empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing
training for IHCA care. Though not proof of causation, nurses appear to be
critical to effective IHCA response, and how to support their role to optimise
outcomes warrants further investigation.

METHODS: We formed a registry of patients with drug-associated infective
endocarditis who underwent valve surgeries at 8 US centers between 2011 and 2017.
Outcomes of first-time valve surgery (FVS) and RVS were compared. Multivariable
logistic regression models related RVS to 30-day mortality. Poisson regression
models were fitted to evaluate temporal trends in overall case volume and
proportions of patients undergoing RVS.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 925 patients with drug-associated infective
endocarditis who underwent a valve surgery, of which 652 were FVS and 273 were
RVS. Patients undergoing FVS had fewer comorbidities than those undergoing RVS.
Overall case volume increased from 108 in 2012 to 229 cases in 2017 (P < .001).
The proportion of redo valve cases increased from 19% in 2012 to 28% in 2017
(P < .001). The 30-day mortality in RVS was higher compared with FVS (8.1% vs
4.8%; P = .049). An increase in unadjusted mortality rates were observed as the
number of prior cardiac surgeries increased, from 4.8% in FVS to 11.8% in ≥3 RVS.
Multivariable model demonstrated that RVS was associated with an increased risk
of 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-4.06;
P = .010).
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing proportion of valve surgery for drug-associated
infective endocarditis is for RVS. Despite being young and harboring few
comorbidities, the RVS cohort is still susceptible to increased risk of 30-day
mortality compared with those undergoing FVS.

review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then
peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus
meeting of the editorial team was organized to conclude on the selection of best 
papers.
RESULTS: Among the 1,469 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various areas 
of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper
describes a simple algorithm detecting co-morbidities in Electronic Healthcare
Records (EHRs) using a clinical data warehouse and a knowledge base. The authors 
of the second best paper present a federated algorithm for predicting heart

Asia, ambitious regional or national plans in Europe are launched that aim at
developing big data and new artificial intelligence technologies to contribute to
the understanding of health and diseases in whole populations and whole health
systems, and returning actionable feedback loops to improve existing models of

defined as Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2 at six months. Performance of a
random forest classifier was compared against a penalized general linear model
(GLM) and expert electroencephalographer review.
RESULTS: Fifty subjects were included and sixteen (32%) had good outcome. Both
QEEG reactivity methods had comparable performance to expert EEG reactivity
assessment for good outcome prediction (mean AUC 0.8 for random forest vs. 0.69
for GLM vs. 0.69 for expert review, respectively; p non-significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models utilizing quantitative EEG reactivity data
can predict long-term outcome after cardiac arrest.
SIGNIFICANCE: A quantitative approach to EEG reactivity assessment may support
prognostication in cardiac arrest.

readmissions in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). The impact 
of aortic insufficiency (AI) on HRAE remains uncertain. We aimed to investigate
the impact of AI on HRAE.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who underwent LVAD implantation between August 2014
and July 2017 and had echocardiograms 3 months post-LVAD implantation were
enrolled. AI severity was assessed by measuring the systolic/diastolic ratio of
flow and the rate of diastolic flow acceleration using Doppler echocardiography
of the outflow cannula. Regurgitation fraction was derived from these parameters.
Significant AI was defined as regurgitation fraction > 30%. Among 105 patients
(median age, 56 years; 76% male), 36 patients (34%) had significant AI. Baseline 
characteristics were statistically not significantly different between those with
and without significant AI except for higher rates of ischemic etiology and
atrial fibrillation in the significant AI group (P < 0.05 for both). One-year
survival free from HRAE was 44% in patients with AI compared to 67% in patients
without significant AI (P = 0.018). The average hemocompatibility score, which
defines the net burden of HRAE, was higher in the AI group (1.72 vs 0.64;
P = 0.009), due mostly to higher tier I (mild HRAE; P = 0.034) and tier IIIB
scores (severe HRAE; P = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: Significant AI, as assessed by Doppler echocardiographic parameters, 
was associated with HRAE during LVAD support.

determinant of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) fate, has emerged as
a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
However, the precise mechanism by which PCSK9 regulates the internalization and
lysosomal degradation of LDLR is unknown. Recently, we identified adenylyl
cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) as a receptor for human resistin whose
globular C-terminus is structurally similar to the C-terminal cysteine-rich
domain (CRD) of PCSK9. Herein, we investigated the role of CAP1 in PCSK9-mediated
lysosomal degradation of LDLR and plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The direct binding between PCSK9 and CAP1 was confirmed by
immunoprecipitation assay, far-western blot, biomolecular fluorescence
complementation, and surface plasmon resonance assay. Fine mapping revealed that 
the CRD of PCSK9 binds with the Src homology 3 binding domain (SH3BD) of CAP1.
Two loss-of-function polymorphisms found in human PCSK9 (S668R and G670E in CRD) 
were attributed to a defective interaction with CAP1. siRNA against CAP1 reduced 
the PCSK9-mediated degradation of LDLR in vitro. We generated CAP1 knock-out mice
and found that the viable heterozygous CAP1 knock-out mice had higher protein
levels of LDLR and lower LDL-C levels in the liver and plasma, respectively, than
the control mice. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PCSK9-induced endocytosis
and lysosomal degradation of LDLR were mediated by caveolin but not by clathrin, 
and they were dependent on binding between CAP1 and caveolin-1.
CONCLUSION: We identified CAP1 as a new binding partner of PCSK9 and a key
mediator of caveolae-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of LDLR.

most common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG
data collected every day, in home and hospital, may preclude data review by human
operators/technicians. Therefore, several methods are proposed for either fully
automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by
human experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant
progress in the past years. However, those methods rely on hand-crafted feature
extraction, which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the
signal (e.g., beat detection). This, plus the high variability in wave morphology
among patients and the presence of noise, make it challenging for computerized
interpretation to achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it
possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction and classification.
Therefore, deep learning approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection.
In this work, we reviewed the recent advancement of deep learning methods for
automatic arrhythmia detection. We summarized existing literature from five
aspects: utilized dataset, application, type of input data, model architecture,
and performance evaluation. We also reported limitations of reviewed papers and

survival rate. Early prediction of cardiac arrest can provide the time required
for intervening and preventing its onset in order to reduce mortality. Several
studies have been conducted to predict cardiac arrest using machine learning.
However, no previous research has used machine learning for predicting cardiac
arrest in adult sepsis patients. Moreover, the potential of some techniques,
including ensemble algorithms, has not yet been addressed in improving the
prediction outcomes. It is required to find methods for generating
high-performance predictions with sufficient time lapse before the arrest. In
this regard, various variables and parameters should also been examined.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to use machine learning in order to propose a cardiac
arrest prediction model for adult patients with sepsis. It is required to predict
the arrest several hours before the incidence with high efficiency. The other
goal was to investigate the effect of the time series dynamics of vital signs on 
the prediction of cardiac arrest.
METHOD: 30 h clinical data of every sepsis patients were extracted from Mimic III
database (79 cases, 4532 controls). Three datasets (multivariate, time series and
combined) were created. Various machine learning models for six time groups were 
trained on these datasets. The models included classical techniques (SVM,
decision tree, logistic regression, KNN, GaussianNB) and ensemble methods
(gradient Boosting, XGBoost, random forest, balanced bagging classifier and
stacking). Proper solutions were proposed to address the challenges of missing
values, imbalanced classes of data and irregularity of time series.
RESULTS: The best results were obtained using a stacking algorithm and
multivariate dataset (accuracy = 0.76, precision = 0.19, sensitivity = 0.77,
f1-score = 0.31, AUC= 0.82). The proposed model predicts the arrest incidence of 
up to six hours earlier with the accuracy and sensitivity over 70%.
CONCLUSION: We illustrated that machine learning techniques, especially ensemble 
algorithms have high potentials to be used in prognostic systems for sepsis
patients. The proposed model, in comparison with the exiting warning systems
including APACHE II and MEWS, significantly improved the evaluation criteria.
According to the results, the time series dynamics of vital signs are of great
importance in the prediction of cardiac arrest incidence in sepsis patients.

between samples in patients with suspected myocardial infarction are not
currently accounted for in diagnostic approaches. We aimed to combine these
variables through machine learning to improve the assessment of risk for
individual patients.
METHODS: A machine learning algorithm (myocardial-ischemic-injury-index [MI3])
incorporating age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
concentrations, was trained on 3,013 patients and tested on 7,998 patients with
suspected myocardial infarction. MI3 uses gradient boosting to compute a value
(0-100) reflecting an individual's likelihood of a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial
infarction and estimates the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV),
specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for that individual. Assessment
was by calibration and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve
(AUC). Secondary analysis evaluated example MI3 thresholds from the training set 
that identified patients as low-risk (99% sensitivity) and high-risk (75% PPV),
and performance at these thresholds was compared in the test set to the 99th
percentile and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) rule-out pathways.
RESULTS: Myocardial infarction occurred in 404 (13.4%) patients in the training
set and 849 (10.6%) patients in the test set. MI3 was well calibrated with a very
high AUC of 0.963 [0.956-0.971] in the test set and similar performance in early 
and late presenters. Example MI3 thresholds identifying low-risk and high-risk
patients in the training set were 1.6 and 49.7 respectively. In the test set, MI3
values were <1.6 in 69.5% with a NPV of 99.7% (99.5%-99.8%) and sensitivity of
97.8% (96.7-98.7%), and were ≥49.7 in 10.6% with a PPV of 71.8% (68.9-75.0%) and 
specificity of 96.7% (96.3-97.1%). Using these thresholds, MI3 performed better
than the ESC 0/3-hour pathway (sensitivity 82.5% [74.5-88.8%], specificity 92.2% 
[90.7-93.5%]) and the 99th percentile at any time-point (sensitivity 89.6%
[87.4-91.6%]), specificity 89.3% [88.6-90.0%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning, MI3 provides an individualized and objective
assessment of the likelihood of myocardial infarction, which can be used to
identify low-risk and high-risk patients who may benefit from earlier clinical
decisions.

devices, and thromboresistant coatings appear to be one of the most attractive
methods to down-regulate the unwanted enzymatic reactions that promote the
formation of blood clots. Among all polymeric materials, polyurethanes (PUs) are 
a class of biomaterials with excellent biocompatibility and bioinertness that are
suitable for the use of thromboresistant coatings. In this work, we investigated 
the thermal and physico-mechanical behaviors of ester-based and ether-based PU
films for potential uses in thromboresistant coatings. Our results show that
poly(ester urethane) and poly(ether urethane) films exhibited characteristic
peaks corresponding to their molecular configurations. Thermal characterizations 
suggest a two-step decomposition process for the poly(ether urethane) films.
Physico-mechanical characterizations show that the surfaces of the PU films were 
hydrophobic with minimal weight changes in physiological conditions over 14 days.
All PU films exhibited high tensile strength and large elongation to failure,
attributed to their semi-crystalline structure. Finally, the in vitro clotting
assays confirmed their thromboresistance with approximately 1000-fold increase in
contact time with human blood plasma as compared to the glass control. Our work

devices.
METHODS: This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study was
performed at a 793-bed academic hospital. The expert-derived approach used an
open-source software with a list of curated terms to query for implantable
devices posing high safety risk (""MRI-Red"") in patients undergoing MRI. The
ontology-derived approach used an NLP system with terms mapped to Systematized
Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. Queries were performed in three clinical
data types-25,000 radiology reports, 174,769 emergency department (ED) notes, and
41,085 other clinical reports (eg, cardiology, operating room, physician notes,
radiology reports, pathology reports, patient letters). Sensitivity, specificity,
and accuracy of both methods against manual review of a randomly sampled 465
reports were assessed and tested for significant differences between
expert-derived and ontology-derived approaches using t test.
RESULTS: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of expert-versus ontology-derived
approaches were similar (0.83 versus 0.91, P = .080; 0.88 versus 0.96, P = .178; 
0.82 versus 0.92, P = .110). The proportion of radiology reports, ED notes, and
other clinical reports retrieved containing implantable devices with high safety 
risks for MRI ranged from 1.47% to 1.88%.
DISCUSSION: Artificial intelligence approaches such as expert-driven NLP and
ontology-driven NLP have similar accuracy in identifying patients with
implantable devices that pose high safety risks for MRI.

assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to
determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in
cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical
assertions, also known as ""regulatory-grade"" RWE.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 
2010-2016.
METHODS: A predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured 
(EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was
evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was
compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy
were compared using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: The dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept
occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes 
mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%,
respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical
concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded
criteria, with the exception of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts
studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S
and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U
did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based 
studes intended for regulatory use. Furthermore, advanced data and technologies
may be required to achieve regulatory grade results.

its use in ameliorating various systemic pathological conditions. The present
study was performed to investigate whether the resveratrol alleviated cardiac
hypertrophy and functional remodelling by regulating autophagy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were exposed to CIH 8 h/day for five weeks
and/or intragastric administration of resveratrol daily. The morphological and
echocardiography were used to evaluate the cardiac protective effects. The
apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. The biochemical assessments were used
to evaluate oxidative stress. Further, the effect of resveratrol on autophagy and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was investigated.
KEY FINDINGS: The CIH group exhibited increased heart weight/body weight and left
ventricle weight/body weight ratios, which was accompanied by left ventricular
remodelling. Echocardiography analysis showed that CIH-treated rats had
significantly higher left ventricular posterior wall thickness, ejection fraction
and fractional shortening than those of controls. In addition, the apoptosis
index and oxidative markers were significantly elevated in the CIH group versus
the control. The autophagy marker Beclin-1 was elevated, while p62 was decreased 
by CIH treatment. Resveratrol treatment significantly improved cardiac function
and alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in CIH rats. 
Further results indicated that PI3K/AKT pathway-mediated inhibition of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway played a role in the activation of
autophagy by resveratrol after CIH stimulation.
SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, resveratrol supplementation during CIH upregulates
autophagy by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which appears to be beneficial 
for resisting cardiac hypertrophy.

Objective: To identify clusters of patients with distinct constellations of
clinical and comorbid patterns who may be associated with an elevated risk of
super-utilization in the year following elective surgery.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of
1 049 160 patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary
artery bypass graft, colectomy, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, 
or lung resection were identified from the 100% Medicare inpatient and outpatient
Standard Analytic Files at all inpatient facilities performing 1 or more of the
evaluated surgical procedures from 2013 to 2015. Data from 2012 to 2016 were used
to evaluate expenditures in the year preceding and following surgery. Using a
machine learning approach known as Logic Forest, comorbidities and interactions
of comorbidities that put patients at an increased chance of becoming a
super-utilizer were identified. All comorbidities, as defined by the Charlson
(range, 0-24) and Elixhauser (range, 0-29) comorbidity indices, were used in the 
analysis. Higher scores indicated higher comorbidity burden. Data analysis was
completed on November 16, 2018.
Main Outcome and Measures: Super-utilization of health care in the year following
surgery.
Results: In total, 1 049 160 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in

and approximately 40% were male. Super-utilizers comprised 4.8% of the overall
cohort (n = 79 746) yet incurred 31.7% of the expenditures. Although the
difference in overall expenditures per person between super-utilizers ($4049) and
low users ($2148) was relatively modest prior to surgery, the difference in
expenditures between super-utilizers ($79 698) vs low users ($2977) was marked in

30, 40, and 50 W) and contact forces (CFs) (10, 30, and 50 g) 20 times for each
setting. The analysis consisted of two protocols. The first protocol was a
comparison between the ablation power and several parameters under the same CF
(10, 30, and 50 g). The second protocol was a comparison between the CF and
several parameters under the same power (20, 30, 40, and 50 W). The correlation
between the lesion formation and ablation parameters was evaluated.
Results: The AI value when steam pops occurred varied depending on the ablation
settings. All AI median values were <500 under an ablation power of 50 W. On
other hand, the median ablation time up to the steam pop was more than
46 seconds, but all median values of the AI were more than 550 under an ablation 
with 20 W.
Conclusions: The AI cannot predict steam pops. A low power and long duration
ablation could obtain a high AI value. However, high-power ablation could not
obtain a high AI value because of an early occurrence of steam pops.",Captcha,NaN

    Gut. 2020 Jan;69(1):2-3.

OBJECTIVE: The Fragile X mental retardation (FMR) syndrome is a frequently
inherited intellectual disability caused by decreased or absent expression of the
FMR protein (FMRP). Lack of FMRP is associated with neuronal degradation and
cognitive dysfunction but its role outside the central nervous system is
insufficiently studied. Here, we identify a role of FMRP in liver disease.
DESIGN: Mice lacking Fmr1 gene expression were used to study the role of FMRP
during tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced liver damage in disease model
systems. Liver damage and mechanistic studies were performed using real-time PCR,
Western Blot, staining of tissue sections and clinical chemistry.
RESULTS: Fmr1null mice exhibited increased liver damage during virus-mediated
hepatitis following infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.
Exposure to TNF resulted in severe liver damage due to increased hepatocyte cell 
death. Consistently, we found increased caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation
following TNF stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate FMRP to be critically
important for regulating key molecules in TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-dependent
apoptosis and necroptosis including CYLD, c-FLIPS and JNK, which contribute to
prolonged RIPK1 expression. Accordingly, the RIPK1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1s could
reduce liver cell death and alleviate liver damage in Fmr1null mice following TNF
exposure. Consistently, FMRP-deficient mice developed increased pathology during 
acute cholestasis following bile duct ligation, which coincided with increased
hepatic expression of RIPK1, RIPK3 and phosphorylation of MLKL.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that FMRP plays a central role in the inhibition of
TNF-mediated cell death during infection and liver disease.

global pandemic with debilitating, expensive and often lethal complications. Even
when hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels are well controlled, and concomitant
cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are effectively treated, two out of every three 
patients with T2D are destined to die from CV complications. Several large
randomized controlled trials (RCT) indicate that two classes of glucose-lowering 
medications, oral sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) and
injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), confer
significant CV benefits, including reductions in: hospitalizations for heart
failure (HF), progression of diabetic kidney disease, atherosclerotic CV events, 
and (with some agents) CV death. These CV benefits appear to be independent of
the glucose-lowering effects of these agents. These compelling findings are
triggering a fundamental paradigm shift in T2D management whereby the focus is no
longer on HbA1c alone, but instead on implementing a comprehensive CV risk
reduction strategy prioritizing the use of these evidence-based therapies (along 
with other evidence-based treatment strategies) with the objective of reducing
the risk of morbid complications, and improving the quantity and quality of life 
of patients with T2D. Cardiologists are uniquely positioned to become more
involved in the management of T2D and established CV disease, which at this time 
should include initiation (either by prescribing or by making recommendations) of
agents proven to reduce CV risk. Specifically, SGLT2-is and/or GLP-1RA have now
been shown to have a favorable risk-benefit balance, and are being increasingly
emphasized by the practice guidelines as preferable treatment options in
vulnerable patients with T2D. The cardiology community should collaborate with
other care providers to ensure that when and where appropriate these new T2D
therapies are used along with other evidence-based therapies to improve patient
outcomes.

(p = .0041). A meta-analysis (combing AD with NHL) implicated genes of apoptosis 
and telomere length. This GWAS-based analysis four NHL subtypes and three ADs
revealed few weakly-associated shared loci, explaining little total risk. This
suggests common genetic variation, as assessed by GWAS in these sample sizes, may
not be the primary explanation for the link between these ADs and NHLs.

used to screen unacceptable electrocardiograms (ECGs) that include noise. To test
that, a deep learning-based model for unacceptable ECG screening was developed,

Methods: To develop and apply the screening model, we used a biosignal database

cardiovascular infection in humans. Here we used microtiter and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) to investigate adhesion by variants of full-length FnBPA
covalently anchored in the outer cell wall of Lactococcus lactis, a Gram-positive
surrogate that otherwise lacks adhesins to mammalian ligands. Fn adhesion
increased in five of seven FnBPA variants under static conditions. The bond
targeting Fn increased its strength with load under mechanical dissociation.
Substitutions extended bond lifetime (1/koff) up to 2.1 times for FnBPA-Fn.
Weaker adhesion was observed for Fg in all FnBPA variants tested with microtiter.
However, mechanical dissociation with AFM showed significantly increased tensile 
strength for Fg interacting with the E652D/H782Q variant. This is consistent with
a force-induced mechanism and suggests that the dock, lock, and latch (DLL)
mechanism is favored for Fg-binding under mechanical stress. Collectively, these 
experiments reveal that FnBPA exhibits bimodal, ligand-dependent adhesive
behavior. Amino acid substitutions in the repeat-region of FnBPA impact binding
to both ligands. This was unexpected for Fg since all variants have the same
A-domain sequence, and the Fg-binding site is distant from the repeat region.
This indicates that FnBRs may fold back on the A-domain in a way that impacts the

patients from healthy controls was developed based on linear and nonlinear heart 
rate variability (HRV), which reflects the autonomic cardiovascular regulation.
METHODS: HRV data were collected from 37 MDD patients and 41 healthy controls
during five 5-min experimental phases: the baseline, a mental stress task, stress
recovery, a relaxation task, and relaxation task recovery. The experimental
protocol was designed to assess the autonomic responses to stress and recovery.
Twenty HRV indices were extracted from each phase, and a total of 100 features
were used for classification using a support vector machine (SVM). SVM-recursive 
feature elimination (RFE) and statistical filter were employed to perform feature
selection.
RESULTS: We achieved 74.4% accuracy, 73% sensitivity, and 75.6% specificity with 
two optimal features selected by SVM-RFE, which were extracted from the stress
task recovery and mental stress phases. Classification performance worsened when 
individual phases were used separately as input data, compared to when all phases
were included. The SVM-RFE using nonlinear and Poincaré plot HRV features
performed better than that using the linear indices and matched the best
performance achieved by using all features.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the machine learning-based diagnosis of MDD using
HRV analysis. Monitoring the changes in linear and nonlinear HRV features for
various autonomic nervous system states can facilitate the more objective
identification of MDD patients.

This paper puts forth a novel bi-linear modeling framework for data recovery via 
manifold-learning and sparse-approximation arguments and considers its
application to dynamic magnetic-resonance imaging (dMRI). Each temporaldomain MR 
image is viewed as a point that lies onto or close to a smooth manifold, and
landmark points are identified to describe the point cloud concisely. To
facilitate computations, a dimensionality reduction module generates
low-dimensional/compressed renditions of the landmark points. Recovery of
high-fidelity MRI data is realized by solving a non-convex minimization task for 
the linear decompression operator and affine combinations of landmark points
which locally approximate the latent manifold geometry. An algorithm with
guaranteed convergence to stationary solutions of the non-convex minimization
task is also provided. The aforementioned framework exploits the underlying
spatiotemporal patterns and geometry of the acquired data without any prior
training on external data or information. Extensive numerical results on
simulated as well as real cardiac-cine MRI data illustrate noteworthy
improvements of the advocated machine-learning framework over state-of-the-art

The network is trained on 2D spatio-temporal slices which are previously
extracted from the image sequences. We compare our approach to two 2D and a 3D
Deep Learning-based post processing methods, three iterative reconstruction
methods and two recently proposed methods for dynamic cardiac MRI based on 2D and
3D cascaded networks. Our method outperforms the 2D spatially trained U-net and
the 2D spatio-temporal U-net. Compared to the 3D spatiotemporal U-net, our method
delivers comparable results, but requiring shorter training times and less
training data. Compared to the Compressed Sensing-based methods kt-FOCUSS and a
total variation regularized reconstruction approach, our method improves image
quality with respect to all reported metrics. Further, it achieves competitive
results when compared to the iterative reconstruction method based on adaptive
regularization with Dictionary Learning and total variation and when compared to 
the methods based on cascaded networks, while only requiring a small fraction of 
the computational and training time. A persistent homology analysis demonstrates 
that the data manifold of the spatio-temporal domain has a lower complexity than 
the one of the spatial domain and therefore, the learning of a projection-like
mapping is facilitated. Even when trained on only one single subject without
data-augmentation, our approach yields results which are similar to the ones
obtained on a large training dataset. This makes the method particularly suitable
for training a network on limited training data. Finally, in contrast to the

This
number is expected to increase to 626 million by 2045. The majority (90-95%) of
people with DM has type 2-diabetes (T2DM). The continued prevalence of DM and
associated complications has prompted investigators to find new therapies. One of
the most recent additions to the anti-diabetic armamentarium are inhibitors of
sodium-glucose co-transporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1, SGLT2). Areas covered: The authors
review the status of SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of T2DM and place an
emphasis on those agents in early phase clinical trials. Data and information
were retrieved from American Diabetes Association, Diabetes UK,
ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Scopus websites. The keywords used in the search 
were T2DM, SGLT1, SGLT2, and clinical trials. Expert opinion: The benefits of
SGLT inhibitors include reductions in serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body
weight, blood pressure and cardiovascular and renal events. However, SGLT
inhibitors increase the risk of genitourinary tract infections, diabetic
ketoacidosis, and bone fractures. The development of SGLT inhibitors with fewer

hormone with poorly defined biology. Here, we investigated the role of GDF15 in
bacterial and viral infections. We found that inflammation induced GDF15, and
that GDF15 was necessary for surviving both bacterial and viral infections, as
well as sepsis. The protective effects of GDF15 were largely independent of
pathogen control or the magnitude of inflammatory response, suggesting a role in 
disease tolerance. Indeed, we found that GDF15 was required for hepatic
sympathetic outflow and triglyceride metabolism. Failure to defend the lower
limit of plasma triglyceride levels was associated with impaired cardiac function
and maintenance of body temperature, effects that could be rescued by exogenous
administration of lipids. Together, we show that GDF15 coordinates tolerance to
inflammatory damage through regulation of triglyceride metabolism.

patients at end of life with clinically meaningful diagnostic accuracy, using
30-day mortality in patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) as a

DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based registry study.
SETTING: Swedish health services.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause 30-day mortality.
METHODS: Electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative data were used to
train six supervised machine learning models to predict all-cause mortality
within 30 days in patients discharged from EDs in southern Sweden, Europe.
PARTICIPANTS: The models were trained using 65 776 ED visits and validated on 55 
164 visits from a separate ED to which the models were not exposed during
training.
RESULTS: The outcome occurred in 136 visits (0.21%) in the development set and in
83 visits (0.15%) in the validation set. The model with highest discrimination
attained ROC-AUC 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.96), with sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.80

CONCLUSIONS: Multiple models displayed excellent discrimination on the validation
set and outperformed available indexes for short-term mortality prediction
interms of ROC-AUC (by indirect comparison). The practical utility of the models 
increases as the data they were trained on did not require costly de novo
collection but were real-world data generated as a by-product of routine care

cardiac death (SCD) among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus
infection (PHIV) with heart failure (HF), who were hospitalized for HF, and the
risk factors associated with it.
BACKGROUND: HF is associated with an increased risk for SCD. PHIV are at
heightened risk for HF.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 2,578 patients hospitalized with HF
from a single academic center, of whom 344 were PHIV. The outcome of interest was
SCD. Subgroup analyses were performed by strata of viral load (VL) and left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%, 35% to 49%, and ≥50%.
RESULTS: Of 2,578 patients with HF, 2,149 (86%) did not have implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators; of these, there were 344 PHIV and 1,805 uninfected
control subjects. Among PHIV with HF, 313 (91%) were prescribed antiretroviral
therapy and 64% were virally suppressed. There were 191 SCDs over a median
follow-up period of 19 months. Compared with control subjects, PHIV had a 3-fold 
increase in SCD (21.0% vs. 6.4%; adjusted odds ratio: 3.0; 95% confidence
interval: 1.78 to 4.24). Among PHIV, cocaine use, lower LVEF, absence of
beta-blocker prescription, and VL were predictors of SCD. The SCD rate among PHIV
with undetectable VL was similar to the rate among uninfected subjects. Similar
findings were observed by LVEF strata. Among PHIV with HF without conventional
indications for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, the rate of SCD was
10% per year.
CONCLUSIONS: PHIV hospitalized with HF are at a markedly increased risk for SCD. 
SCD risk was increased in patients with lower LVEFs, lower CD4 counts, and higher
VL.

mortality in the world, with elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C)
levels as the major risk factor. Lower levels of LDL-C can effectively reduce the
risk of cardiovascular diseases. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) plays an important role in regulating the degradation of hepatic LDL
receptors that remove LDL-C from the circulation. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new
class of agents that are becoming increasingly important in the treatment to
reduce LDL-C levels. Two PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, have been
approved to treat hypercholesterolemia and are available in the United States and
the European Union. Through the inhibition of PCSK9 and increased recycling of
LDL receptors, serum LDL-C levels can be significantly reduced.
OBJECTIVE: This review will describe the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and
pharmacodynamics of PCSK9 inhibitors and their clinical effects.

with the development of many disorders including many cancer types. Breast cancer
is one of that associated with a high mortality rate. Adipocytes, a major
cellular component in adipose tissue, are dysfunctional during obesity and also
known to promote breast cancer development both in vitro and in vivo.
Dysfunctional adipocytes can release metabolic substrates, adipokines, and
cytokines, which promote proliferation, progression, invasion, and migration of
breast cancer cells. The secretion of adipocytes can alter gene expression
profile, induce inflammation and hypoxia, as well as inhibit apoptosis. It is
known that excessive free fatty acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, hormones,
leptin, interleukins, and chemokines upregulate breast cancer development.
Interestingly, adiponectin is the only adipokine that has anti-tumor properties. 
Moreover, adipocytes are also related to chemotherapeutic resistance, resulting
in the poorer outcome of treatment and advanced stages in breast cancer.
Evaluation of the adipocyte secretion levels in the circulation can be useful for
prognosis and evaluation of the effectiveness of cancer therapy in the patients. 
Therefore, understanding about functions of adipocytes as well as obesity in
breast cancer may reveal novel targets that support the development of new

the operational performance of closed-loop human-machine systems can be enhanced

observations becoming a reliable methodology to evaluate the human operator's

therapies is key to preventing a rise in adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
cancer patients. Over-diagnosis of cardiotoxicity in this context is however
equally hazardous, leading to patients receiving suboptimal cancer treatment,
thereby impacting cancer outcomes. Accurate screening therefore depends on the
widespread availability of sensitive and reproducible biomarkers of
cardiotoxicity, which can clearly discriminate early disease. Blood biomarkers
are limited in cardiovascular disease and clinicians generally still use generic 
screening with ejection fraction, based on historical local expertise and
resources. Recently, however, there has been growing recognition that simple
measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction using 2D echocardiography may
not be optimal for screening: diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility and
feasibility are limited. Modern cancer therapies affect many myocardial pathways:
inflammatory, fibrotic, metabolic, vascular and myocyte function, meaning that
multiple biomarkers may be needed to track myocardial cardiotoxicity. Advanced
imaging modalities including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), computed
tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) add improved sensitivity
and insights into the underlying pathophysiology, as well as the ability to
screen for other cardiotoxicities including coronary artery, valve and
pericardial diseases resulting from cancer treatment. Delivering screening for
cardiotoxicity using advanced imaging modalities will however require a
significant change in current clinical pathways, with incorporation of machine
learning algorithms into imaging analysis fundamental to improving efficiency and
precision. In the future, we should aspire to personalized rather than generic
screening, based on a patient's individual risk factors and the
pathophysiological mechanisms of the cancer treatment they are receiving. We
should aspire that progress in cardiooncology is able to track progress in
oncology, and to ensure that the current 'one size fits all' approach to
screening be obsolete in the very near future.",Captcha,NaN

worldwide. The disease-related socioeconomic burden is expected to increase with 
the steadily increasing life expectancy. In spite of decades of clinical and
basic research, most strategies designed to manage degenerative brain diseases
are palliative. This is not surprising as neurodegeneration progresses ""silently""
for decades before symptoms are noticed. Importantly, conceptual models with
heuristic value used to study neurodegeneration have been constructed
retrospectively, based on signs and symptoms already present in affected
patients; a circumstance that may confound causes and consequences. Hence,
innovative, paradigm-shifting views of the etiology of these diseases are
necessary to enable their timely prevention and treatment. Here, we outline four 
alternative views, not mutually exclusive, on different etiological paths toward 
neurodegeneration. First, we propose neurodegeneration as being a secondary
outcome of a primary cardiovascular cause with vascular pathology disrupting the 
vital homeostatic interactions between the vasculature and the brain, resulting
in cognitive impairment, dementia, and cerebrovascular events such as stroke.
Second, we suggest that the persistence of senescent cells in neuronal circuits
may favor, together with systemic metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration to occur.
Third, we argue that neurodegeneration may start in response to altered body and 
brain trophic interactions established via the hardwire that connects peripheral 
targets with central neuronal structures or by means of extracellular vesicle
(EV)-mediated communication. Lastly, we elaborate on how lifespan body dysbiosis 
may be linked to the origin of neurodegeneration. We highlight the existence of
bacterial products that modulate the gut-brain axis causing neuroinflammation and
neuronal dysfunction. As a concluding section, we end by recommending research
avenues to investigate these etiological paths in the future. We think that this 
requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual research approach based on
the investigation of the multimodal aspects of physiology and pathophysiology. It
involves utilizing proper conceptual models, experimental animal units, and
identifying currently unused opportunities derived from human data. Overall, the 
proposed etiological paths and experimental recommendations will be important
guidelines for future cross-discipline research to overcome the translational
roadblock and to develop causative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",Captcha,NaN

public concern because of its high prevalence rate and potential risk of
alteration of brain functions and organizations. Cue exposure therapy is designed
for reducing or maintaining craving, a core factor of relapse of addiction, and
is extensively employed in addiction treatment. In a previous study, we proposed 
a machine-learning-based method to detect craving for gaming using multimodal
physiological signals including photoplethysmogram, galvanic skin response, and
electrooculogram. Our previous study demonstrated that a craving for gaming could
be detected with a fairly high accuracy; however, as the feature vectors for the 
machine-learning-based detection of the craving of a user were selected based on 
the physiological data of the user that were recorded on the same day, the
effectiveness of the reuse of the machine learning model constructed during the
previous experiments, without any further calibration sessions, was still
questionable. This ""high test-retest reliability"" characteristic is of importance
for the practical use of the craving detection system because the system needs to
be repeatedly applied to the treatment processes as a tool to monitor the
efficacy of the treatment. We presented short video clips of three addictive
games to nine participants, during which various physiological signals were
recorded. This experiment was repeated with different video clips on three
different days. Initially, we investigated the test-retest reliability of 14
features used in a craving detection system by computing the intraclass
correlation coefficient. Then, we classified whether each participant experienced
a craving for gaming in the third experiment using various classifiers-the
support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), centroid displacement-based
kNN, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest-trained with the
physiological signals recorded during the first or second experiment.
Consequently, the craving/non-craving states in the third experiment were
classified with an accuracy that was comparable to that achieved using the data
of the same day; thus, demonstrating a high test-retest reliability and the
practicality of our craving detection method. In addition, the classification
performance was further enhanced by using both datasets of the first and second
experiments to train the classifiers, suggesting that an individually customized 
game craving detection system with high accuracy can be implemented by
accumulating datasets recorded on different days under different experimental
conditions.",Captcha,NaN

Rationale: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early
morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation, but the immunologic
mechanisms are poorly understood. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a heterogeneous
family of immune cells regulating pathologic inflammation and beneficial tissue
repair. However, whether changes in donor-derived lung ILC populations are
associated with PGD development has never been examined.Objectives: To determine 
whether PGD in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease
transplant recipients is associated with alterations in ILC subset composition
within the allograft.Methods: We performed a single-center cohort study of lung
transplantation patients with surgical biopsies of donor tissue taken before, and
immediately after, allograft reperfusion. Donor immune cells from 18 patients
were characterized phenotypically by flow cytometry for single-cell resolution of
distinct ILC subsets. Changes in the percentage of ILC subsets with reperfusion
or PGD (grade 3 within 72 h) were assessed.Measurements and Main Results:
Allograft reperfusion resulted in significantly decreased frequencies of natural 
killer cells and a trend toward reduced ILC populations, regardless of diagnosis 
(interstitial lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Seven
patients developed PGD (38.9%), and PGD development was associated with selective
reduction of the ILC2 subset after reperfusion. Conversely, patients without PGD 
exhibited significantly higher ILC1 frequencies before reperfusion, accompanied
by elevated ILC2 frequencies after allograft reperfusion.Conclusions: The
composition of donor ILC subsets is altered after allograft reperfusion and is
associated with PGD development, suggesting that ILCs may be involved in
regulating lung injury in lung transplant recipients.",Captcha,NaN

this study was to build predictive models of hERG activity by deep neural

networks with different architectures were implemented to build classification
models. The optimal model M15 with three hidden layers, undersampling method, and
2D descriptors yielded the prediction accuracy of 0.78 and F1 score of 0.75 on
the test set as well as accuracy of 0.77 and F1 score of 0.34 on the external
validation set, outperforming the other 35 models including 9 random forest
models. Particularly, the optimal model M15 achieved the highest F1 score and the
second highest accuracy when compared with other five methods from four groups
using different machine learning algorithms with the same external validation
set. It can be believed that this model has powerful capability on prediction of 
hERG toxicity, which is of great benefit for developing novel drug candidates.

A
maladaptive epithelium due to chronic injury is a prominent feature and
contributor to pathogenic cellular communication in IPF. Recent data highlight
the concept of a ""reprogrammed"" lung epithelium as critical in the development of
lung fibrosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potent mediator of cellular
crosstalk, and recent evidence supports their role in lung pathologies such as
IPF. Here, we demonstrate that syndecan-1 is overexpressed by the epithelium in
the lungs of IPF patients and in murine models after bleomycin injury. Moreover, 
we find that syndecan-1 is a pro-fibrotic signal that alters alveolar type II
(ATII) cell phenotypes by augmenting TGFβ and Wnt signaling among other
pro-fibrotic pathways. Importantly, we demonstrate that syndecan-1 controls the
packaging of several anti-fibrotic microRNAs into EVs that have broad effects
over several fibrogenic signaling networks as a mechanism of regulating
epithelial plasticity and pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our work reveals new 
insight into how EVs orchestrate cellular signals that promote lung fibrosis and

or 8 weeks (chronic MI, n = 6) after surgery with sequential injection of
0.15 mmol/kg Gd3+ and Mn2+ chelate. The biodistribution of Mn2+ in tissues and

compared with the histology. The Mn2+ chelate group maintained a stable
hemodynamic status during experiment. For acute and chronic MI, all rabbits
survived without significant differences in HR or LV function before and after
injection of Mn2+ chelate or Gd3+ (p > 0.05). Mn2+ chelate mainly accumulated in 
the kidney, liver, spleen, and heart at 1.5 h, with low tissue uptake and urine
residue at 24 h after injection. In the acute MI group, there was no significant 
difference in IF between Mn2+ chelate-DEMRI and histology (22.92 ± 2.21% vs.
21.79 ± 2.25%, respectively, p = 0.87), while Gd3+ -DEMRI overestimated IF, as
compared with histology (24.54 ± 1.73%, p = 0.04). In the chronic MI group, there
was no significant difference in IF between the Mn2+ chelate-DEMRI, Gd3+ -DEMRI, 
and histology (29.50 ± 11.39%, 29.95 ± 9.40%, and 29.00 ± 10.44%, respectively,

Q waves, cardiac blocks, pacemaker implantation, left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) <55%, and/or congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death)
in systemic sclerosis (SSc).
METHODS: 601 patients with SSc were enrolled from 1 December 2012 to 30 November 
2015 and had a second visit 0.5-4 years apart. 153 received no vasodilators; 448 
received vasodilator therapy (ie, calcium channel blockers and/or ACE inhibitors

also treated with either endothelin receptor antagonists or PDE5 inhibitors or
prostanoids. Associations between the occurrence of myocardial disease

    N Engl J Med. 2019 Dec 26;381(26):2582-2584.

BACKGROUND: Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is 
caused by loss of lipoprotein lipase activity and characterized by
chylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There are no effective
therapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome,
antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic APOC3 mRNA with volanesorsen led to
decreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels.
METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with
familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1
ratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the
percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.
RESULTS: Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma
apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, corresponding
to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo had an
increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 mg per
deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving
volanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a
mean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]),
whereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride
levels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per
liter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter])
(P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as
compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of
less than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 patients
who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of the
patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo
group had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 patients
in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels below
25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per microliter
after enhanced platelet-monitoring began.
CONCLUSIONS: Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per
deciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome.
Thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events. (Funded

of diseases and decisions on patient therapies. There are several accepted
methods for preservation of tissues, among which the most popular are
fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded methods. Depending on the
preservation method and the amount of sample available, various specific
protocols are available for tissue processing for subsequent proteomic analysis. 
Protocols are tailored to answer various biological questions, and as such vary
in lysis and digestion conditions, as well as duration. The existence of diverse 
tissue-sample protocols has led to confusion in how to choose the best protocol
for a given tissue and made it difficult to compare results across sample types. 
Here, we summarize procedures used for tissue processing for subsequent bottom-up
proteomic analysis. Furthermore, we compare protocols for their variations in the
composition of lysis buffers, digestion procedures, and purification steps. For
example, reports have shown that lysis buffer composition plays an important role
in the profile of extracted proteins: the most common are
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and ammonium
bicarbonate buffers. Although, trypsin is the most commonly used enzyme for
proteolysis, in some protocols it is supplemented with Lys-C and/or chymotrypsin,
which will often lead to an increase in proteome coverage. Data show that the
selection of the lysis procedure might need to be tissue-specific to produce
distinct protocols for individual tissue types. Finally, selection of the
procedures is also influenced by the amount of sample available, which range from
biopsies or the size of a few dozen of mm2 obtained with laser capture
microdissection to much larger amounts that weight several milligrams.

homeostasis. But abundant research has shown that vitamin D also plays a

activity. Since the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is widely distributed in vascular
endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, the role of
vitamin D and VDR in hypertension has received extensive attention. Hypertension 
is a disease with high incidence and high cardiovascular risk. In recent years,
both clinical trials and animal experiments have shown that vitamin D plays a
regulatory role in decreasing blood pressure (BP) through inhibiting
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity, modulating function of vascular
wall and reducing vascular oxidative stress. A growing body of data suggest that 
vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk in 
hypertension, even short-term vitamin D deficiency may directly raise BP and
promote target organ damage. Due to the high correlation between vitamin D and
hypertension, vitamin D supplementation therapy may be a new insight in the
treatment of hypertension. The aim of this review will explore the mechanisms of 
the vitamin D and VDR in regulating the BP and protecting against the target
organ damage.

xenotransplantation research.
RECENT FINDINGS: Genetically engineered pigs, beginning with human (h)
CD55-transgenic and Gal-knockout pigs, have improved the outcomes of
xenotransplantation research. Today, there are more than 30 different genetically
engineered pigs either expressing human gene(s) or lacking pig gene(s).
CRIPSR/cas9 technology has facilitated the production of multigene pigs (up to
nine genes in a single pig), which lack multiple pig xenoantigens, and express
human transgenes, such as hCD46, hCD55, hThrombomodulin, hCD39, etc. Although
recent studies in nonhuman primates (NHPs) have demonstrated prolonged survival
after life-supporting pig kidney, heart, and islet xenotransplantation,
researchers have difficulty determining the best genetic combination to test in
NHPs because of a potential greater than 100 000 genetic combinations.
3D-bioprinting of genetically engineered pig cells: is superior to 2D in-vitro
testing, enables organ-specific testing, helps to understand differences in
immunogenicity between organs, and is faster and cheaper than testing in NHPs.
Moreover, 3D-bioprinted cells can be continuously perfused in a bioreactor,
controlling for all variables, except the studied variable.

limited accuracy in the identification of advanced lesions. Radiomics-based
machine learning (ML) could provide a more accurate tool. Purpose To compare the 
diagnostic performance of radiomics-based ML with that of visual and
histogram-based assessment of ex vivo coronary CT angiography cross sections to
identify advanced atherosclerotic lesions defined with histologic examination.
Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 21 coronary arteries from seven 
hearts obtained from male donors (mean age, 52.3 years ± 5.3) were imaged ex vivo
with coronary CT angiography between February 23, 2009, and July 31, 2010. From
95 coronary plaques, 611 histologic cross sections were coregistered with
coronary CT cross sections. Lesions were considered advanced if early
fibroatheroma, late fibroatheroma, or thin-cap atheroma was present. CT cross
sections were classified as showing homogeneous, heterogeneous, or napkin-ring
sign plaques on the basis of visual assessment. The area of low attenuation (<30 
HU) and the average Hounsfield unit were quantified. Radiomic parameters were
extracted and used as inputs to ML algorithms. Eight radiomics-based ML models
were trained on randomly selected cross sections (training set, 75% of the cross 
sections) to identify advanced lesions. Visual assessment, histogram-based
assessment, and the best ML model were compared on the remaining 25% of the data 
(validation set) by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC) to identify advanced lesions. Results After excluding sections with
no visible plaque (n = 134) and with heavy calcium (n = 32), 445 cross sections
were analyzed. Of those 445 cross sections, 134 (30.1%) were advanced lesions.
Visual assessment of the 445 cross sections indicated that 207 (46.5%) were
homogeneous, 200 (44.9%) were heterogeneous, and 38 (8.5%) demonstrated the
napkin-ring sign. A radiomics-based ML model incorporating 13 parameters
outperformed visual assessment (AUC = 0.73 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of

sensitising nociceptors. A role for NGF in modulating myocardial injury through
ischaemic nociceptive signalling is plausible. We examined whether inhibition of

underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: In adult rats, lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA targeted at
reducing NGF gene expression (NGF-shRNA) or a transient receptor potential
vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist (capsazepine) was injected intrathecally before
myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion. Infarct size (expressed as the ratio of area at

to 0.37 (0.02) (P<0.01) and reduced arrhythmia score from 3.67 (0.33) to 1.67
(0.33) (P<0.01). Intrathecal capsazepine was similarly cardioprotective.
NGF-shRNA suppressed expression of SP/CGRP and activation of Akt/ERK and TRPV1 in
spinal cord. NGF increased capsaicin current amplitude from 144 (42) to 840 (132)
pA (P<0.05), which was blocked by the TRPV1 antagonist 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin.
Exogenous NGF enhanced capsaicin-induced Akt/ERK and TRPV1 activation in PC12
neuroendocrine tumour cells in culture.
CONCLUSIONS: Spinal NGF contributes to myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury by
mediating nociceptive signal transmission.

a ratio of 1:2 by age and sex. Participants who had been diagnosed with DM before
2007 were excluded. We compared the risk for DM between physicians and

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is not a specific or sensitive method. A

METHODS</strong> We selected 21 patients with pathologically proven acute
myocarditis. We analyzed the EGE findings (total/serial number and location of
positive-segments using the 17-segment model according to the American Heart

    Lancet. 2019 Sep 7;394(10201):812-813.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected
but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening
methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We
aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying
patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning.
METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph 
(ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic
signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using
standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older
with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG
acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31,
1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under 
cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a
rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial
fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing
datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the
receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to 
select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We
evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs.
FINDINGS: We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for 
analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset,
64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 
ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8·4%) patients in the
testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm
ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation
with an AUC of 0·87 (95% CI 0·86-0·88), sensitivity of 79·0% (77·5-80·4),
specificity of 79·5% (79·0-79·9), F1 score of 39·2% (38·1-40·3), and overall
accuracy of 79·4% (79·0-79·9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month
of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before 
the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0·90
(0·90-0·91), sensitivity to 82·3% (80·9-83·6), specificity to 83·4% (83·0-83·8), 
F1 score to 45·4% (44·2-46·5), and overall accuracy to 83·3% (83·0-83·7).
INTERPRETATION: An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits
identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation.
FUNDING: None.

contracting factors to control the local blood flow. Hypertension is a common
side effect of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) inhibitors.
However, the role of endothelial mTORC1 in hypertension remains elusive. The
present study aimed to determine the role of endothelial mTORC1 in Ang II
(angiotensin II)-induced hypertension and the underlying mechanism. Endothelial
mTORC1 activity was increased by Ang II both in vitro and in vivo. Blood pressure
was higher in Tie-2-Cre-mediated regulatory associated protein of mTOR (mammalian
target of rapamycin; Raptor) heterozygous-deficient (Tie2Cre-RaptorKD) mice than 
control mice both before and after Ang II infusion. Acetylcholine-evoked
endothelium-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries was impaired in
Tie2Cre-RaptorKD mice. Treatment with indomethacin or a specific COX
(cyclooxygenase)-2 inhibitor, NS-398, but not L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester
reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in Raptorflox/- mice to a similar extent
as in Tie2Cre-RaptorKD mice. Metabolomic profiling revealed that the plasma
content of prostaglandin E2 was reduced in Tie2Cre-RaptorKD mice with or without 
Ang II infusion. In endothelial cells, reduction of the protein level of YAP
(yes-associated protein) with siRNA-mediated RPTOR deficiency was autophagy
dependent and transcriptionally regulated the expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1
(microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1). Hence, overexpression of YAP in
endothelial cells enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of COX-2 and mPGES-1 and
reversed the endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in Tie2Cre-RaptorKD mice.
The present results demonstrate that suppression of mTORC1 activity in
endothelial cells reduces prostaglandin E2 production and causes hypertension by

trigeminovascular activation and sensitization. However, the underlying cellular 
and molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: A rat model of conscious migraine was established through the electrical
stimulation (ES) of the dural mater surrounding the superior sagittal sinus.
Using patch clamp recording, immunofluorescent labelling, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays and western blot analysis, we studied the effects of ES on
sensory neuronal excitability and elucidated the underlying mechanisms mediated
by voltage-gated ion channels.
RESULTS: The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level in the jugular vein
blood and the number of CGRP-positive neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TGs)
were significantly increased in rats with ES-induced migraine. The application of
ES increased actional potential firing in both small-sized IB4-negative (IB4-)
and IB4+ TG neurons. No significant changes in voltage-gated Na+ currents were
observed in the ES-treated groups. ES robustly suppressed the transient outward
K+ current (IA) in both types of TG neurons, while the delayed rectifier K+
current remained unchanged. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the protein
expression of Kv4.3 was significantly decreased in the ES-treated groups, while
Kv1.4 remained unaffected. Interestingly, ES increased the P/Q-type and T-type
Ca2+ currents in small-sized IB4- TG neurons, while there were no significant
changes in the IB4+ subpopulation of neurons.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ES decreases the IA in small-sized TG
neurons and increases P/Q- and T-type Ca2+ currents in the IB4- subpopulation of 
TG neurons, which might contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability in a rat model

uncertainties regarding the primary and secondary prevention of VTE and the
optimal duration of antithrombotic therapy. A growing body of literature points
to clinically relevant differences between VTE phenotypes (e.g. deep vein

Extensive links to cardiovascular, inflammatory and immune-related morbidities
are testament to the complexity of the disease. The GMP-VTE project is a
prospective, multi-center cohort study on individuals with objectively confirmed 
VTE. Sequential data sampling was performed at the time of the acute event and
during serial follow-up investigations. Various data levels (e.g. clinical,
genetic, proteomic and platelet data) are available for multi-dimensional data
analyses by means of advanced statistical, bioinformatic and machine learning
methods. The GMP-VTE project comprises n = 663 individuals with acute VTE (mean
age: 60.3 ± 15.9 years; female sex: 42.8%). In detail, 28.4% individuals
(n = 188) had acute isolated DVT, whereas 71.6% subjects (n = 475) had PE with or
without concomitant DVT. In the study sample, 28.9% (n = 129) of individuals with
PE and 30.1% (n = 55) of individuals with isolated DVT had a recurrent VTE event 
at the time of study enrolment. The systems-oriented approach for the
comprehensive dataset of the GMP-VTE project may generate new biological insights
into the pathophysiology of VTE and refine our current understanding and

Massachusetts as a prospective study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 
Through data mining processes, three data models were elaborated and a
comparative methodological study between the different ML algorithms - decision
tree, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, and logistic
regression - was carried out. The global selection criterium for choosing the
right set of hyperparameters and the type of data manipulation was the area under
a curve (AUC). The software tools used to analyze the data were R-Studio® and
RapidMiner®.
RESULTS: The Framingham study open database contains 4240 observations. The
algorithm that yielded the greatest AUC when analyzing the data in R-Studio was
neural network applied to a model that excluded all observations in which there
was at least one missing value (AUC = 0.71); when analyzing the data in
RapidMiner and applying the same model, the best algorithm was support vector
machines (AUC = 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: ML algorithms can reinforce the diagnostic and prognostic capacity
of traditional regression techniques. Differences between the applicability of
those algorithms and the results obtained with them were a function of the
software platforms used in the data analysis.

major prerequisite for cardiovascular cell replacement therapies. Pluripotent
stem cells provide a suitable source for the development of new strategies to
overcome enormous hurdles such as yield, purity and safety of in vitro generated

METHODS: To address these issues, we have refined existing forward programming
protocols by combining forced exogenous overexpression of the early
cardiovascular transcription factor Nkx2.5 with a αMHC-promoter-based antibiotic 
selection step. Additionally, we applied small molecules such as ascorbic acid to
enhance cardiomyogenic differentiation efficiency. Subsequently, we evaluated the
cell fate of the resulting cardiomyocytes on the mRNA as well as protein levels. 
The latter was performed using high-resolution confocal microscopy. Furthermore, 
we examined the response of the cells` beating activities to pharmacological
substance administration.
RESULTS: Our results reveal an apparent influence of Nkx2.5 on the cell fate of
ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Resulting single cells exhibit characteristics of
early ventricular cardiomyocytes, such as sarcomeric marker expression,
spontaneous beating frequency, and distinct L-type calcium channel occurrence.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, we demonstrate cardiovascular subtype forward programming 
of ESCs using a combination of transcription factors along with small molecule
administration. However, our findings also underline current assumptions, that a 
terminal maturation of PSC derived cardiomyocytes in vitro is still an unsolved
problem which urgently needs to be addressed in the field.

recognition of dsDNA leads to the assembly of a large multiprotein oligomeric

secretion of bioactive interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and induction of an
inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Sensing of dsDNA by AIM2 in
the cytosol is crucial to mediate protection against the invading pathogens
including bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites. AIM2 also responds to dsDNA
released from damaged host cells, resulting in the secretion of the effector
cytokines thereby driving the progression of sterile inflammatory diseases such
as skin disease, neuronal disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease
and diabetes. Additionally, the protection mediated by AIM2 in the development of
colorectal cancer depends on its ability to regulate epithelial cell
proliferation and gut microbiota in maintaining intestinal homeostasis

best intervention for each individual patient remains uncertain and the use of a

clinicians combine general scientific information and personal experience in the

sense, clinicians already use a somehow personalized medicine strategy. However, 
the influence of their interpretative personal models may lead to bias related to
personal convictions, not sufficiently grounded on scientific evidence. Hence, an
effort to give some advice based on the science of personalized medicine could
have positive effects on clinicians' decisions. Based on a narrative review of

first-step attempt of evidence-based personalized therapy for PD. We focused on
some phenomenological profiles, encompassing symptoms during/outside panic
attacks, related patterns of physiological functions, and some aspects of
physical health, which might be worth considering when developing treatment plans
for patients with PD. We considered respiratory, cardiac, vestibular, and

treatment. Given the extensiveness of the topic, we considered only medications

ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are
well-documented.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to determine the relationship between digoxin
discontinuation and outcomes in hospitalized patients with HFrEF receiving more
contemporary guideline-directed medical therapies including beta-blockers and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
METHODS: Of the 11,900 hospitalized patients with HFrEF (EF ≤45%) in the
Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment
in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) registry, 3,499 received
pre-admission digoxin, which was discontinued in 721 patients. Using propensity
scores for digoxin discontinuation, estimated for each of the 3,499 patients, a
matched cohort of 698 pairs of patients, balanced on 50 baseline characteristics 
(mean age 76 years; mean EF 28%; 41% women; 13% African American; 65% on
beta-blockers) was assembled.
RESULTS: Four-year post-discharge, digoxin discontinuation was associated with
significantly higher risks of HF readmission (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.05 to 1.39; p = 0.007), all-cause readmission (HR:
1.16; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.31; p = 0.010), and the combined endpoint of HF
readmission or all-cause mortality (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.34; p = 0.002),
but not all-cause mortality (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.24; p = 0.163).
Discontinuation of digoxin was associated with a significantly higher risk of all
4 outcomes at 6 months and 1 year post-discharge. At 30 days, digoxin
discontinuation was associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR:
1.80; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.57; p = 0.001) and the combined endpoint (HR: 1.36;
95% CI: 1.09 to 1.71; p = 0.007), but not of HF readmission (HR: 1.19; 95% CI:
0.90 to 1.59; p = 0.226) or all-cause readmission (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.84 to
1.26; p = 0.778).
CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized older patients with HFrEF on more contemporary
guideline-directed medical therapies, discontinuation of pre-admission digoxin
therapy was associated with poor outcomes.

Ballistocardiogram Signals Based on Deep Learning.

Hersek S, Semiz B, Shandhi MMH, Orlandic L, Inan OT.

The ballistocardiography (BCG) signal is a measurement of the vibrations of the
center of mass of the body due to the cardiac cycle and can be used for
noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring. The seismocardiography (SCG) signals measure 
the local vibrations of the chest wall due to the cardiac cycle. While BCG is a
more well known modality, it requires the use of a modified bathroom scale or a
force plate and cannot be measured in a wearable setting, whereas SCG signals can
be measured using wearable accelerometers placed on the sternum. In this work we 
explore the idea of finding a mapping between zero mean and unit l2-norm SCG and 
BCG signal segments such that, the BCG signal can be acquired using wearable
accelerometers (without retaining amplitude information). We use neural networks 
to find such a mapping and make use of the recently introduced UNet architecture.
We trained our models on 26 healthy subjects and tested them on 10 subjects. Our 
results show that we can estimate the aforementioned segments of the BCG signal
with a median Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a median absolute
deviation (MAD) of 0.17. Furthermore, our model can estimate the R-I, R-J and R-K
timing intervals with median absolute errors (and MAD) of 10.00 (8.90), 6.00
(5.93) and 8.00 (5.93), respectively. We show that using all three axis of the
SCG accelerometer produces the best results while the head-to-foot SCG signal
produces the best results when a single SCG axis is used.",Captcha,NaN

angiogenesis.
Methods: Primary retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) were used for
RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunolabeling, Ca2+ signaling, and whole-cell
patch-clamp studies while localization of TRPV1 also was assessed in retinal
endothelial cells using whole mount preparations. The effects of pharmacologic
blockers of TRPV1 and TRPV4 on retinal angiogenic activity was evaluated in vitro
using sprout formation, cell migration, proliferation, and tubulogenesis assays, 
and in vivo using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).
Heteromultimerization of TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels in RMECs was assessed using
proximity ligation assays (PLA) and electrophysiologic recording.
Results: TRPV1 mRNA and protein expression were identified in RMECs. TRPV1
labelling was found to be mainly localized to the cytoplasm with some areas of
staining colocalizing with the plasma membrane. Staining patterns for TRPV1 were 
broadly similar in endothelial cells of intact vessels within retinal flat
mounts. Functional expression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 in RMECs was confirmed by
patch-clamp recording. Pharmacologic inhibition of TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels
suppressed in vitro retinal angiogenesis through a mechanism involving the
modulation of tubulogenesis. Blockade of these channels had no effect on
VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis or Ca2+ signals in vitro. PLA and patch-clamp
studies revealed that TRPV1 and TRPV4 form functional heteromeric channel
complexes in RMECs. Inhibition of either channel reduced retinal
neovascularization and promoted physiologic revascularization of the ischemic
retina in the OIR mouse model.
Conclusions: TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels represent promising targets for therapeutic
intervention in vasoproliferative diseases of the retina.",Captcha,NaN

diagnosing cardiovascular disease. In order to avoid image artifacts caused by
patient movement during imaging, we take deep learning-based methods to generate 
DSA image from single live image without the mask image.
METHODS: Conventional clinical DSA datasets are acquired with a standard
injection protocol. More than 600 sequences obtained from more than 100 subjects 
were used for head and leg experiments. Here, the residual dense block (RDB) is
adopted to generate DSA image from single live image directly, and RDBs can
extract high-level features by dense connected layers. To obtain better vessel
details, a supervised generative adversarial network strategy is also used in the
training stage.
RESULTS: The human head and leg experiments show that the deep learning methods
can generate DSA image from single live image, and our method can do better than 
other models. Specifically, the DSA image generating with our method contains
less artifact and is suitable for diagnosis. We use metrics including PSNR, SSIM 
and FSIM, which can reach 23.731, 0.877 and 0.8946 on the head dataset and
26.555, 0.870 and 0.9284 on the leg dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: The experiment results show the model can extract the vessels from

is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was first identified as a transcriptional regulator of
type-I interferons (IFNs) and IFN inducible genes. Our study aims to explore the 
role of IRF1 in atherosclerotic foam cell formation and understand the functional
diversity of IRF1 in various cell types contributing to atherosclerosis. Methods:
We induced experimental atherosclerosis in ApoE-/-IRF1-/- mice and evaluated the 
effect of IRF1 on disease progression and foam cell formation. Results: IRF1
expression was increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. IRF1
deficiency inhibited modified lipoprotein uptake and promoted cholesterol efflux,
along with altered expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism. Gene
expression analysis identified scavenger receptor (SR)-AI as a regulated target
of IRF1, and SR-AI silencing completely abrogated the increased uptake of
modified lipoprotein induced by IRF1. Our data also explain a mechanism
underlying endotoxemia-complicated atherogenesis as follows: two likely
pro-inflammatory agents, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exert cooperative effects on foam cell formation, which
is partly attributable to a shift of IRF1-Ubc9 complex to IRF1- myeloid
differentiation primary response protein 88 (Myd88) complex and subsequent IRF1
nuclear translocation. Additionally, it seems that improved function of vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) also accounts for the diminished and more stable
atherosclerotic plaques observed in ApoE-/-IRF1-/- mice. Conclusions: Our
findings demonstrate an unanticipated role of IRF1 in the regulation of gene

The TGF-β signaling pathway is activated in the cardiac tissue of chronic phase
patients and is associated with an increase in extracellular matrix protein
expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of GW788388, a
selective inhibitor of TβR1/ALK5, on cardiac function in an experimental model of
chronic Chagas' heart disease. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were infected with
Trypanosoma cruzi (102 parasites from the Colombian strain) and treated orally
with 3mg/kg GW788388 starting at 120 days post-infection (dpi), when 100% of the 
infected mice show cardiac damage, and following three distinct treatment
schedules: i) single dose; ii) one dose per week; or iii) three doses per week
during 30 days. The treatment with GW788388 improved several cardiac parameters: 
reduced the prolonged PR and QTc intervals, increased heart rate, and reversed
sinus arrhythmia, and atrial and atrioventricular conduction disorders. At 180
dpi, 30 days after treatment interruption, the GW3x-treated group remained in a
better cardiac functional condition. Further, GW788388 treatment reversed the
loss of connexin-43 enriched intercellular plaques and reduced fibrosis of the
cardiac tissue. Inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway reduced TGF-β/pSmad2/3,
increased MMP-9 and Sca-1, reduced TIMP-1/TIMP-2/TIMP-4, and partially restored
GATA-6 and Tbox-5 transcription, supporting cardiac recovery. Moreover, GW788388 
administration did not modify cardiac parasite load during the infection but
reduced the migration of CD3+ cells to the heart tissue. Altogether, our data
suggested that the single dose schedule was not as effective as the others and
treatment three times per week during 30 days seems to be the most effective
strategy. The therapeutic effects of GW788388 are promising and suggest a new

chains. Further highlighting the importance of the short-chain lipid geometry for
late fission, we find that shorter forms of PA and DAG promote the vesiculation

sphingophospholipids. Cell surface LPP3 can terminate the signaling actions of
bioactive lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1 phosphate, which likely
explains its role in developmental angiogenesis, vascular injury responses, and
cell migration. Heritable variants in the final intron PLPP3 associate with
interindividual variability in coronary artery disease risk that may result from 
disruption of enhancer sequences that normally act in cis to increase expression 
of the gene. However, the mechanisms regulating PLPP3 expression are not well
understood. We show that the human PLPP3 promoter contains three functional NF-κB
response elements. All of these are required for maximal induction of PLPP3
promoter activity in reporter assays. The identified sequences recruit RelA and
RelB components of the NF-κB transcription complex to chromatin, and these
transcription factors bind to the identified target sequences in two different
cell types. LPA promotes binding of Rel family transcription factors to the PLPP3
promoter and increases PLPP3 gene expression through mechanisms that are
attenuated by an NF-κB inhibitor, LPA receptor antagonists, and inhibitors of
phosphoinositide 3 kinase. These findings indicate that up-regulation of PLPP3
during inflammation and atherosclerosis results from canonical activation of the 
NF-κB signaling cascade to increase PLPP3 expression through nuclear import and
binding of RelA and RelB transcription factors to the PLPP3 promoter and suggest 
a mechanism by which the LPP3 substrate, LPA, can regulate PLPP3 expression.",Captcha,NaN

higher type 2 MI (T2MI, due to coronary supply-demand mismatch) rates among
persons with HIV (PWH). In the general population, T2MI has higher mortality than
type 1 MI (T1MI, spontaneous and generally due to plaque rupture and thrombosis).
PWH have a greater burden of comorbidities and may therefore have an even greater
excess risk for complication and death in the setting of T2MI. However, mortality
patterns after T1MI and T2MI in HIV are unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed mortality after MI among PWH enrolled in the multicenter,
US-based Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS)
cohort (N = 28,186). Incident MIs occurring between January 1, 1996, and December
31, 2014, were centrally adjudicated and classified as T1MI or T2MI. We first
compared mortality following T1MI vs. T2MI among PWH. Cox survival analyses and
Bayesian model averaging were then used to evaluate pre-MI covariates associated 
with mortality following T1MI and T2MI.
RESULTS: Among the 596 out of 28,186 PWH who experienced MI (2.1%; 293 T1MI and
303 T2MI), mortality rates were significantly greater after T2MI (22.2/100
person-years; 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality 39%, 52%, and 62%) than T1MI (8.2/100 
person-years; 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality 15%, 22%, and 30%). Significant
mortality predictors after T1MI were higher HIV viral load, renal dysfunction,
and older age. Significant predictors of mortality after T2MI were low body-mass 
index (BMI) and detectable HIV viral load.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high following MI for PWH and substantially greater
after T2MI than T1MI. Predictors of death after MI differed by type of MI,
reinforcing the different clinical scenarios associated with each MI type and the

neuromuscular block induced by aminosteroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs.
Compared to reversal with neostigmine, it reverses neuromuscular block quicker
and more predictable and without cholinergic side effects. However, there have
been concerns about sugammadex ability to bind other drugs and its effects on QT 
interval and clotting times. In addition, sugammadex might induce
hypersensitivity reactions more frequently than initially anticipated. This
review summarizes current evidence with regard to these and other safety aspects 
of sugammadex. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the efficacy of
sugammadex in various patient populations, evaluates potential interactions with 
other drugs and discusses adverse effects and reactions that have been reported
in the literature. Expert opinion: Sugammadex quickly reverses aminosteroid
neuromuscular block with less side effects compared to neostigmine. As such, it
has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of residual neuromuscular
block and to improve postoperative pulmonary outcome. Current safety concerns
mainly focus on hypersensitivity reactions and cardiac arrhythmias. Although the 
absolute risk for these events is low, ongoing vigilance and research in this
area are needed.",Captcha,NaN

cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study
aged ≥35 with (n = 209) and without (n = 92) HIV who underwent carotid ultrasound
in 2004-2005 and had stored serum available for measurement of total adiponectin

the study-wide false-positive rate. HIV-positive women had significantly higher
adiponectin than HIV-negative women after adjustment for sociodemographic,
behavioral, and clinical variables [beta = 0.29 (95% confidence interval
0.11-0.47)]. Among HIV-positive women, lower CD4 count was associated with higher
adiponectin and history of AIDS with higher CTRP9, but these were only nominally 
significant. There was no relationship between HIV status and CTRP 1, 3, or 5,
nor was antiretroviral therapy or viral load associated with any CTRP. In the
entire cohort, higher adiponectin was associated with significantly lower fasting
glucose and insulin resistance, while higher CTRP5 [beta = -0.02 (-0.033 to
-0.007)]-and, at a nominal level, CTRPs 1 and 3-was associated with significantly
lower carotid intima-media thickness. In conclusion, in this sample of
middle-aged women, HIV serostatus was positively associated with adiponectin, but
not CTRPs. In turn, serum adiponectin was inversely associated with glucose
dysregulation, whereas CTRP5 was inversely associated with carotid intima-media
thickness. Further research is needed to determine CTRPs' role in

biotechnology development. Currently, nucleic acid tests rely on enzymatic
processes for target amplification (e.g., PCR), which have many inherent issues
restricting their implementation in diagnostics. On the other hand, there exist
no protein amplification techniques, greatly limiting the development of
protein-based diagnosis. We report a universal biomolecule enrichment technique
termed hierarchical nanofluidic molecular enrichment system (HOLMES) for
amplification-free molecular diagnostics using massively paralleled and
hierarchically cascaded nanofluidic concentrators. HOLMES achieves billion-fold
enrichment of both nucleic acids and proteins within 30 min, which not only
overcomes many inherent issues of nucleic acid amplification but also provides
unprecedented enrichment performance for protein analysis. HOLMES features the
ability to selectively enrich target biomolecules and simultaneously deplete
nontargets directly in complex crude samples, thereby enormously enhancing the
signal-to-noise ratio of detection. We demonstrate the direct detection of
attomolar nucleic acids in urine and serum within 35 min and HIV p24 protein in
serum within 60 min. The performance of HOLMES is comparable to that of nucleic
acid amplification tests and near million-fold improvement over standard
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for protein detection, being much
simpler and faster in both applications. We additionally measured human cardiac

living with HIV experience depression at 2-3 times the rate of the general
population. Recent research has shown that a person's level of social
connectedness (e.g., social networks) is important to understanding their health 
and ability to get help when they need it. The scientific rationale of this work 
is to determine whether there is a direct relationship between levels of
depression and a measure of social connectedness in people with HIV who are at
higher than normal risk of depression and depressive symptoms. WHAT THIS PAPER
ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We examined the relationship between levels of
depression and social capital in people living with HIV to determine whether
depression may influence their beliefs about their social connectedness and
available resources. We found that as depression increases, self-reported social 
capital decreases, suggesting that people living with HIV who are depressed may
feel less socially connected and/or not be confident they can access resources
when they need them. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Mental health nurses
are particularly well-positioned to help people living with HIV who are living
with depression by helping them build skills for building and maintaining
relationships, adhering to co-administered HIV and mental health medical
treatments, and helping these individuals to identify and address barriers to
social connectedness. Helping people living with HIV to address depression and
promoting social connectedness can not only improve quality of life, but have
major long-term health benefits. Abstract Introduction People living with HIV
(PLWH) are disproportionately burdened by depression, with estimates as high as
80% of PLWH reporting depressive symptoms. Depression in PLWH is complex, and has
been linked with biological and psychosocial causes, including low social
capital. Few studies have examined the relationship between social capital and
depression in PLWH. Aim/Question We conducted a secondary analysis of the
relationship between social capital (Social Capital Scale score) and depression
(Beck Depression Inventory-II scores) to determine whether depression predicted
levels of social capital in a sample of 108 PLWH. Results Depression was
significantly associated with lower social capital r(105) = -.465 p < .001.
Depression remained a significant predictor of social capital in the linear
regression model, F(5,101) = 8.508, p < .000, R2  = 0.296, when controlling for
age and education level. Discussion Our results suggest that depression may be a 
significant predictor of low social capital, and these factors may have cyclical 
relationships that explain persistent depression in this population. Implications
for practice Mental health nurses are particularly well-positioned to help PLWH
who are living with depression by helping them build skills for building and
maintaining relationships, adhering to co-administered HIV and mental health
medical treatments, and helping these individuals to identify and address
barriers to social connectedness.

a heartbeat, assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively
translating actin relative to myosin filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing
ATP free energy into actin movement against resisting force. Cardiac myosin
binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity probably by transient
N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin
filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these
proteins involving them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) cause single residue substitutions with independent
characteristics (sequence location, residue substitution, human demographic, and 
allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent phenotype and pathogenicity
characteristics in a feed-forward neural network model. Trial models train and
validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins then
predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in
myosin, mybpc3, or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional
probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given independent SNP
characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP pathogenicity vs
(in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in
particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident
subpopulation bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages
multiple sarcomere proteins functionally. Consistent with this observation,
mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with myosin essential light
chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent mechanism adapting myosin
force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the integral
myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in
understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (VW-MRI) images can prevent the progression of
cardiovascular disease. However, the manual inspection process of the VW-MRI
images is cumbersome and has low reproducibility. Therefore in this paper, by
using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we develop a deep morphology
aided diagnosis (DeepMAD) network for automated segmentation of the VW of carotid
artery and for automated diagnosis of the carotid atherosclerosis with the
black-blood (BB) VW-MRI (i.e., the T1-weighted MRI) in a slice-by-slice manner.
METHODS: The proposed DeepMAD network consists of a segmentation subnetwork and a
diagnosis subnetwork for performing the segmentation and diagnosis tasks on the
BB-VW-MRI images, where the manual labeled lumen area, the manual labeled outer
wall area and the manual labeled lesion Types based on the modified American
Heart Association (AHA) criteria are used as the ground-truth. Specifically, a
deep U-shape CNN with a weighted fusion layer is designed as the segmentation
subnetwork, where the lumen area and the outer wall area can be simultaneously
segmented under the supervision of the triple Dice loss to provide the vessel
wall map as morphological information. Then, the image stream from the BB-VWMRI
image and the morphology stream from the obtained vessel wall map are extracted
from two deep CNNs and combined to obtain the diagnosis results of
atherosclerosis in the diagnosis subnetwork. In addition, the triple input set is
formed by three carotid regions of interest (ROIs) from three consecutive slices 
of the MRI sequence and input to the DeepMAD network, where the first and last
slices used as additional adjacent slices to provide 2.5D spatial information
along the carotid artery centerline for the intermediate slice, which is the
target slice for segmentation and diagnosis in the study.
RESULTS: Compared to other existing methods, the DeepMAD network can achieve
promising segmentation performances (0.9594 Dice for the lumen and 0.9657 Dice
for the outer wall) and better diagnosis Accuracy of the carotid atherosclerosis 
(0.9503 AUC and 0.8916 Accuracy) in the test dataset (including invisible
subjects) from same source as the training dataset. In addition, the trained
DeepMAD model can be successfully transferred to another test dataset for
segmentation and diagnosis tasks with remarkable performance (0.9475 Dice for the
lumen and 0.9542 Dice for the outer wall, 0. 9227 AUC and 0.8679 Accuracy for
diagnosis).
CONCLUSIONS: Even without the intervention of reviewers required for previous
works, the proposed DeepMAD network automatically segments the lumen and the
outer wall together and diagnoses the carotid atherosclerosis with high
performances. The DeepMAD network can be used in clinical trials to help
radiologists get rid of tedious reading tasks, such as screening review to
separate the normal carotid from the atherosclerotic arteries and outlining the
vessel wall contours.

autoimmunity in mice and humans. Ets1 is expressed in both B and T cells, and
mice lacking Ets1 are characterized by excess B and T cell activation, leading to
enhanced formation of Ab-secreting cells and high titers of autoantibodies. In
humans, genome-wide association studies have detected associations of single
nucleotide polymorphisms in the human ETS1 gene with autoimmune diseases,
including lupus. An increased fraction of CD4+ T cells from Ets1-/- mice have an 
activated effector-memory phenotype, and there are aberrations in differentiation
that contribute to the autoimmune phenotype. In vitro studies of B cells suggest 
that Ets1 may have B cell-intrinsic effects as well. To confirm B cell-intrinsic 
roles for Ets1, we crossed CD19-Cre mice to mice with a floxed allele of Ets1.
Mice with a B cell-specific deletion of Ets1 show increases in B cell activation,
numbers of Ab-secreting cells, and levels of autoantibodies, despite the fact
that T cells are normal. However, when compared with conventional Ets1 knockout
mice, mice with B cell-specific loss of Ets1 have a significantly milder
phenotype. These results demonstrate that Ets1 is required in B cells to prevent 
autoimmune responses but that loss of Ets1 activity in other cell types is
required for maximal autoimmune phenotypes.

breast cancer survivors. Some breast cancer treatments including anthracyclines, 
trastuzumab and radiotherapy can increase the risk of CVD, especially for
patients with pre-existing CVD risk factors. Early identification of patients at 
increased CVD risk may allow switching to less cardiotoxic treatments, active
surveillance or treatment of CVD risk factors. One of the strongest independent
CVD risk factors is the presence and extent of coronary artery calcifications
(CAC). In clinical practice, CAC are generally quantified on ECG-triggered
cardiac CT scans. Patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy routinely
undergo radiotherapy planning CT scans of the chest, and those scans could
provide the opportunity to routinely assess CAC before a potentially cardiotoxic 
treatment. The Bragatston study aims to investigate the association between
calcifications in the coronary arteries, aorta and heart valves (hereinafter
called 'cardiovascular calcifications') measured automatically on planning CT
scans of patients with breast cancer and CVD risk.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a first step, we will optimise and validate a deep
learning algorithm for automated quantification of cardiovascular calcifications 
on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer. Then, in a multicentre
cohort study (University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Erasmus MC Cancer
Institute, Rotterdam and Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), the association 
between cardiovascular calcifications measured on planning CT scans of patients
with breast cancer (n≈16 000) and incident (non-)fatal CVD events will be
evaluated. To assess the added predictive value of these calcifications over
traditional CVD risk factors and treatment characteristics, a case-cohort
analysis will be performed among all cohort members diagnosed with a CVD event
during follow-up (n≈200) and a random sample of the baseline cohort (n≈600).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Boards of the participating
hospitals decided that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not
apply. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at
conferences.

growing. However, the potential impact of some widely used concomitant
medications is still largely unclear. Emerging data suggest that gut microbiota
may affect the efficacy of ICIs, leading to the hypothesis that concurrent
antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors use could have a detrimental effect. In
addition, steroid use might potentially impair the activity of immunotherapy, due
its known immunosuppressive effects, and some safety concerns have been raised in

trials evaluating ICIs consistently excluded patients receiving high
corticosteroid doses and data regarding other concomitant medications are
lacking. Recently, several retrospective studies have tried to address this unmet
medical need. Herein we discuss the latest evidence on the influence of these

correlation between LSD1 and Ox-LDL-induced inflammation.
MAIN METHODS: RAW264.7 cells were used during the whole study. Firstly, the
effect of Ox-LDL-stimulation on LSD1 expression was detected. Through
loss-of-function assay, the associations between LSD1 interference and SESN2
expression, autophagy, NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cytokines were

KEY FINDINGS: The expression of LSD1 was significantly elevated in Ox-LDL-treated
RAW264.7 cells. Inhibition of LSD1 promoted autophagy, inhibited inflammation and

compared with computed tomography in measurement of the aortic valve annulus in

measurements by this software and computed tomography will show acceptable
correlation.
DESIGN: This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective data 
collection of patients with aortic stenosis who underwent implantation of a
transcatheter heart valve with intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography, 
multidetector computed tomography, and use of the Siemens eSie Valves automated
aortic valve software.
SETTING: Intraprocedural in a single hospital institution.
PARTICIPANTS: The participants are 47 patients who underwent implantation of an
Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve.
INTERVENTIONS: The authors compared aortic valve annulus measurements by
two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and the
automated software.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Aortic annulus measurements by the software
correlated more closely to the computed tomography measurements than
two-dimensional measurements. Bland-Altman analysis showed qualitative
comparability of measurements performed by the automated software to computed
tomography (95% limits of agreement between -4.62 mm and 1.26 mm for area-derived
and -4.51 mm and 1.45 mm for perimeter-derived methods). Similarly, there was
significant linear correlation with automated software use (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001 
and r = 0.85, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Periprocedural aortic valve measurement by automated
echocardiographic software correlates with computed tomography in patients with
severe aortic stenosis. This technology is helpful and accurate, but has
limitations.

of the leading causes of global death. Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) is
a member of TRIM family that has been found to be involved in atherosclerosis.
However, the role of TRIM28 in atherosclerosis remains unknown. This study aimed 
to investigate the effects of TRIM28 on the phenotypic switching of human aortic 
smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), which is considered as a fundamental event during
the development of atherosclerosis. The results showed that TRIM28 was highly
expressed in human atherosclerotic tissues, as well in cultured HASMCs stimulated
by platelet-derived growth factor subunit B homodimer (PDGF-BB). Knockdown of
TRIM28 by transfection with siRNA targeting TRIM28 (si-TRIM28) significantly
suppressed the PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and migration of HASMCs.
Besides, knockdown of TRIM28 inhibited the expressions of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The VSMC markers including α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA), calponin and SM22α were upregulated in TRIM28 knocked down HASMCs.
Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM28 blocked PDGF-BB-induced NF-κB activation in
HASMCs. Collectively, knockdown of TRIM28 prevented PDGF-BB-induced phenotypic
switching of HASMCs, which might be mediated by the regulation of NF-κB signaling
pathway.

structure have the potential to positively impact the screening timelines in drug
discovery. Previous works suggested that fu,inc is primarily driven by passive
processes and can be described using physicochemical properties such as
lipophilicity and the protonation state of the molecule. While models based on
these principles proved predictive in relatively small datasets that included
marketed drugs, their applicability domain has not been extensively explored. The
work presented here from the in silico ADME discussion group (part of the
International Consortium for Innovation through Quality in Pharmaceutical
Development, the IQ consortium) describes the accuracy of these models in large
proprietary datasets that include several thousand of compounds across chemical
space. Overall, the models do well for compounds with low lipophilicity. In other
words, the equations correctly predict that fu,inc is, in general, above 0.5 for 
compounds with a calculated logP of less than 3. When applied to lipophilic
compounds, the models failed to produce quantitatively accurate predictions of
fu,inc, with a high risk of underestimating binding properties. These models can,
therefore, be used quantitatively for less lipophilic compounds. On the other
hand, internal machine-learning models using a company's own proprietary dataset 
also predict compounds with higher lipophilicity reasonably well. Additionally,
the data shown indicate that microsomal binding is, in general, a good proxy for 
hepatocyte binding.",Downloaded successfully,/Users/rima/Desktop/test_folder/nih.gov/31348668.pdf

mortality rates before and after linkage with Indian Health Service records,
adjusting for racial misclassification. We focused on differences in racial
misclassification by gender, age, geographic differences, substate planning
districts, and cause of death. Our secondary purpose was to evaluate time trends 
in misclassification from 1991 to 2015.
DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive study.
SETTING: Oklahoma.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons contained in the Oklahoma State Health Department Vital
Records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate the age-adjusted mortality ratio pre- and
post-Indian Health Service record linkage (misclassification rate ratio) and to
evaluate the overall trend of racial misclassification on mortality records
measured through annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change
(AAPC).
RESULTS: We identified 2 stable trends of racial misclassification upon death for
American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) from 1991 to 2001 (APC: -0.2%; 95%
confidence interval: -1.4% to 1.0%) and from 2001 to 2005 (APC: -6.9%; 95%
confidence interval: -13.7% to 0.4%). However, the trend identified from 2005 to 
2015 decreased significantly (APC: -1.4%; 95% confidence interval: -2.5% to
-0.2%). For the last 5 years available (2011-2015), the racial misclassification 
adjustment resulted in higher mortality rates for AI/ANs reflecting an increase
from 1008 per 100 000 to 1305 per 100 000 with the linkage process. There were an
estimated 3939 AI/ANs in Oklahoma who were misclassified as another race upon
death in those 5 years, resulting in an underestimation of actual AI/AN deaths by
nearly 29%.
CONCLUSIONS: An important result of this study is that misclassification is
improving; however, this effort needs to be maintained and further improved.

METHODS: The data set included 57 baseline F-florbetapir (Amyvid; Lilly,
Indianapolis, IN) brain PET scans in participants with severe white matter
disease, presenting with either transient ischemic attack/lacunar stroke or mild 
cognitive impairment from early Alzheimer disease, enrolled in a multicenter

generate SUV ratios, normalized to cerebellar gray matter, and clinically read by
2 nuclear medicine physicians with interpretation based on consensus (35

supervised training of an RF classifier programmed in MATLAB.
RESULTS: A 10,000-tree RF, each tree using 15 randomly selected cases and 20
randomly selected features (SUV ratio per region of interest), with 37 cases for 
training and 20 cases for testing, had sensitivity = 86% (95% confidence interval

identification of clinically relevant features. However, traditional statistical 
methods may ignore important information in datasets or overlook possible
interactions among features. Machine learning may improve the prediction accuracy

features in hypertensive patients. We sought the most relevant features for
prediction of cardiovascular (CV) events in a hypertensive population. We used
the penalized regression models least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO) and elastic net (EN) to obtain the most parsimonious and accurate models.
The clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers were collected from the
clinical records of 1,471 patients receiving care at Mostoles University
Hospital. The outcome was the development of major adverse CV events. Cox
proportional hazards regression was performed alone and with penalized regression
analyses (LASSO and EN), producing three models. The modeling was performed using
10-fold cross-validation to fit the penalized models. The three predictive models
were compared and statistically analyzed to assess their classification accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, discriminative power, and calibration accuracy. The
standard Cox model identified five relevant features, while LASSO and EN
identified only three (age, LDL cholesterol, and kidney function). The accuracies
of the models (prediction vs. observation) were 0.767 (Cox model), 0.754 (LASSO),
and 0.764 (EN), and the areas under the curve were 0.694, 0.670, and 0.673,
respectively. However, pairwise comparison of performance yielded no
statistically significant differences. All three calibration curves showed close 
agreement between the predicted and observed probabilities of the development of 
a CV event. Although the performance was similar for all three models, both
penalized regression analyses produced models with good fit and fewer features
than the Cox regression predictive model but with the same accuracy. This case
study of predictive models using penalized regression analyses shows that
penalized regularization techniques can provide predictive models for CV risk
assessment that are parsimonious, highly interpretable, and generalizable and
that have good fit. For clinicians, a parsimonious model can be useful where
available data are limited, as such a model can offer a simple but efficient way 
to model the impact of the different features on the prediction of CV events.
Management of these features may lower the risk for a CV event. Graphical
Abstract In a clinical setting, with numerous biological and laboratory features

Although this syndrome negatively impacts the outcome of critical illness,
understanding of its pathophysiology is limited. Also, new therapies that
increase iron availability for erythropoiesis during AI are upcoming. A model of 
AI induced by bacterial infections that are relevant for the critically ill is
currently not available. This paper describes the development of an animal model 
for AI that is relevant for critical care research.
RESULTS: In experiments with rats, the rats were inoculated either repeatedly or 
with a slow release of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rats
became ill, but their hemoglobin levels remained stable. The use of a higher dose
of bacteria resulted in a lethal model. Then, we turned to a model with longer
disease duration, using pigs that were supported by mechanical ventilation after 
inoculation with P. aeruginosa. The pigs became septic 12 to 24 h after
inoculation, with a statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure 
and base excess, while heart rate tended to increase. Pigs needed resuscitation
and vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure > 60 mmHg. After
72 h, the pigs developed anemia (baseline 9.9 g/dl vs. 72 h, 7.6 g/dl, p = 0.01),
characterized by statistically significant decreased iron levels, decreased
transferrin saturation, and increased ferritin. Hepcidin levels tended to
increase and transferrin levels tended to decrease.
CONCLUSIONS: Using pathogens commonly involved in pulmonary sepsis, AI could not

considered together with the evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials.
Expert opinion: Statins are the first-line lipid-lowering therapy in patients
with CVD and CKD. Some statins require dose adjustments based on renal function, 
whereas atorvastatin does not. Ezetimibe can be prescribed in patients with CVD
and CKD, usually combined with a statin. According to current guidelines,
statin±ezetimibe therapy should not be initiated, but should be continued, in
dialysis-treated CKD patients. Fenofibrate (dose adjusted or contra-indicated

whether they also exert cardiorenal benefits in patients with CVD and CKD remains
to be established. The use of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9

tolerance and immunity, respectively, resulting in altered T-cell trafficking. We
hypothesized that laminins directly regulated T-cell activation and polarization.
METHODS: Human and mouse CD4 T cells were activated in Th1, Th2, Th17, or
regulatory T cell (Treg) environments with/without laminin α4 and/or α5. Laminin 
α5 receptors were blocked with anti-α6 integrin or anti-α-dystroglycan (αDG)

transgenic TEa CD4 cells that recognized donor alloantigen were transferred into 
C57BL/6 mice that received alloantigen or cardiac allografts. Laminin receptors
were blocked, and TEa T-cell migration and differentiation were assessed. Laminin
expression was measured in several models of immunity and tolerance.
RESULTS: In diverse models, laminins α4 and α5 were differentially regulated.
Immunity was associated with decreased laminin α4:α5 ratio, while tolerance was
associated with an increased ratio. Laminin α4 inhibited CD4+ T-cell
proliferation and Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarization but favored Treg induction.
Laminin α5 favored T-cell activation and Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarization and
inhibited Treg. Laminin α5 was recognized by T cell integrin α6 and is important 
for activation and inhibition of Treg. Laminin α5 was also recognized by T cell
α-DG and required for Th17 differentiation. Anti-α6 integrin or anti-DG prolonged
allograft survival.

suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) which limits IL-6 signalling. Current
PAH therapies include prostanoid drugs which induce vasodilation via stimulating

inhibit IL-6-mediated endothelial dysfunction via the induction of SOCS3. Thus,
we propose that an important mechanism by which cAMP-mobilising prostanoid drugs

via SOCS3 inhibition of IL-6 signalling. Further clarification may result in
effective strategies with which to target the IL-6/JAK-STAT signalling pathway in

However, the role of CD4+ T cells in this disease is not well defined. Methods
and Results We used a mouse model of schistosomiasis-associated PH, induced by
intraperitoneal egg sensitization followed by intravenous egg challenge, with
outcomes including right ventricle systolic pressure measured by cardiac
catheterization, and cell density and phenotype assessed by flow cytometry. We
identified that embolization of Schistosoma eggs into lungs of egg-sensitized

recruitment of cells from the circulation and triggered type 2 inflammation.
Parabiosis confirmed that egg embolization is required for localized type 2

given that deletion of CD4+ T cells or inhibiting their Th2 function protected
against type 2 inflammation and PH following Schistosoma exposure. We also

the effect of CV on cardiac function in diabetes mellitus (DM) rats. We found
that the cardiac dysfunction of DM rats was markedly improved by CV extract
treatment. CV extract administration significantly attenuated cardiac fibrosis in
DM rats, which was accompanied by suppressed transforming growth factor beta 1
(TGF-β1)/Smad signaling as indicated by decreased levels of TGF-β1, p-Smad2, and 
p-Smad3 and increased Smad7 expression. Moreover, CV extract treatment
significantly alleviated cardiac inflammation as shown by decreased levels of
NLRP3 receptor, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 in DM rats at least partly
due to the inhibition of the NF-κB. In addition, high-glucose treatment induced
cardiac fibrosis and increased cardiac inflammation in cardiac fibroblast cells, 
but these effects were ameliorated by CV extract treatment. Therefore, we
conclude that the protective effect of CV on DCM is associated with the
suppression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling and attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome
activation, suggesting that CV extract may be a potential therapeutic agent for
DCM.

address this fragmentation by contributing research into the robustness and

mechanisms of how TMAO induces atherosclerosis and CVDs' progression are still
unclear. In this regard, high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), an
inflammatory mediator, has been reported to disrupt cell-cell junctions,
resulting in vascular endothelial hyper permeability leading to endothelial
dysfunction. The present study tested whether TMAO associated endothelial
dysfunction results via HMGB1 activation. Biochemical and RT-PCR analysis showed 
that TMAO increased the HMGB1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in
endothelial cells. However, prior treatment with glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 binder,
abolished the TMAO-induced HMGB1 production in endothelial cells. Furthermore,
Western blot and immunofluorescent analysis showed significant decrease in the
expression of cell-cell junction proteins ZO-2, Occludin, and VE-cadherin in TMAO
treated endothelial cells compared with control cells. However, prior treatment
with glycyrrhizin attenuated the TMAO-induced cell-cell junction proteins'
disruption. TMAO increased toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in endothelial

cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unclear whether HIV and HCV are also
associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We examined the association of
HIV, HCV, and traditional CVD risk factors with PAD in the Women's Interagency
HIV Study, a multicenter US cohort.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, ankle-brachial index was estimated using 
Doppler ultrasound and manual sphygmomanometer in 1899 participants aged more
than 40 years with HIV/HCV coinfection, HCV or HIV monoinfection, or neither
infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of PAD
(ankle-brachial index ≤0.9) after controlling for demographic, behavioral, and
CVD risk factors.
RESULTS: Over two-thirds were African-American, median age was 50 years, and PAD 
prevalence was 7.7% with little difference by infection status. After
multivariable adjustment, neither HIV nor HCV infection was associated with
greater odds of PAD. Factors associated with PAD included older age [adjusted
odds ratio (aOR): 2.01 for age 61-70 vs. 40-50 years; 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.04, 3.87], Black race (aOR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 4.63), smoking (aOR: 1.27

10 mmHg; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.28).
CONCLUSION: The high PAD prevalence in this nationally representative cohort of
women with or at risk for HIV is on par with general population studies in
individuals a decade older than our study's median age. HIV and HCV infection are
not associated with greater PAD risk relative to uninfected women with similar

accepted indefinitely in C57BL/6 (B6) mice, through regulatory tolerance
mechanism dependent on Foxp3 cells. In contrast, B6 kidneys are rejected within a
week in DBA/2J recipients. We hypothesized that the tolerogenic difference of the
kidneys might be due to differences in number or function of plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDCs), because these cells are potent inducers of Foxp3 cells.
METHODS: pDCs from murine bone marrow, native kidneys, and spontaneously accepted
kidney allografts were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemical
staining. Naive T cells were cocultured with pDCs in specific strain combinations
and analyzed for FoxP3 induction and functionality. MEK/ERK and NFκB inhibitors
were used to assess the regulatory T-cell induction pathways. pDCs and T-cell
cultures were adoptively transferred before heterotopic heart transplantation to 
assess allograft survival.
RESULTS: DBA/2J pDCs were more potent in inducing Foxp3 in B6 T cells than the
reverse combination, correlating with survival of the kidney allografts. Foxp3
induction by pDCs in vitro was dependent on pDC viability, immaturity, and class 
II MHC mismatch and blocked by MEK/ERK and NFκB inhibition. pDC-induced Foxp3 T
cells suppressed proliferation of B6 T cells in vitro, and adoptive transfer into
B6 recipients 2 weeks before heterotopic DBA/2J heart transplantation resulted in
prolonged allograft survival.

PMBS/AMBS questions about fatigue around medication and disease. Each point
increase in ""disease frustration"" at visit 1 on the AMBS/PMBS doubled the odds of
a lower-than-threshold TAC level at visit 2. No clear change in overall level of 
perceived barriers to medication adherence in the first year post-transplant was

solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is a growing problem, though CDI risk
factors in this population are poorly understood. Our objective was to
characterize CDI risk factors in pediatric SOT recipients.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study, performed at a single
freestanding academic children's hospital, included all SOT recipients age
1-22 years who were tested for C. difficile by toxin B gene PCR between August
2009 and August 2017. CDI risk factors were assessed by comparing PCR-positive

RESULTS: Between August 2009 and August 2017, 409 SOTs were performed of which
138 (33.7%), 134 (32.8%), 131 (32.0%), and 6 (1.5%) were kidney, liver, heart,

for CDI, with 723 C. difficile PCR tests performed among these patients. 68/205
(33%) patients developed CDI at least once during the study period. Median
(interquartile range) time to diagnosis of first CDI following SOT was 8.9 (1.2,

CONCLUSIONS: CDI is a common, relatively late post-transplant complication and
independently associated with calcineurin inhibitor and systemic antibiotic
exposure. The potential impact of specific immunosuppressive drug and antibiotic 
selection on CDI risk reduction requires further investigation.

central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and QTc interval-prolonging medications
and risk of mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and
at-risk HIV-uninfected women.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study (Women's Interagency
HIV Study [WIHS]).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4150 women enrolled in the WIHS study between 1994 and
2014 who were infected (3119 women) or not infected (1031 women) with HIV.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on medication utilization were collected from
all study participants via interviewer-administered surveys at 6-month intervals 
(1994-2014). Mortality was confirmed by National Death Index data. With age
defining the time scale for the analysis, Cox proportional hazards models were
used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality in HIV-infected and 
-uninfected women and non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) deaths in
HIV-infected women. A total of 1046 deaths were identified, of which 429 were
considered non-AIDS deaths. Use of benzodiazepines, CNS depressants (excluding
methadone), and number of medications with conditional QTc interval-prolonging
effects were each associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate models of
HIV-infected women: hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI)

95% CI 1.00-1.33, p=0.047, respectively. Other explanatory variables for
all-cause mortality in this model included HIV viral load, CD4+  cell count,
renal function, hemoglobin and albumin levels, HIV treatment era, employment
status, existence of depressive symptoms, ever use of injection drugs, and
tobacco smoking. Of interest, use of CNS depressants (excluding methadone) was
also associated with non-AIDS deaths (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.49-2.2, p<0.0001).
Although use of benzodiazepines and conditional QT interval-prolonging
medications were associated with increased risk of non-AIDS mortality (HR 1.32
and 1.25, respectively), the effect was not statistically significant (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of HIV-infected and at-risk HIV-uninfected women, use 
of benzodiazepines, CNS depressants, and conditional QTc interval-prolonging
medications were associated with a higher risk of mortality independent of
methadone and other well-recognized mortality risk factors. Care must be taken to
assess risk when prescribing these medications in this underserved and at-risk
patient population.

average, beyond age 4 y, after multiple critical periods of brain development

Abnormalities were already present before the onset of symptoms and were rescued

highlighted that curcumin could decreases tumor growth and invasion by acting on 
both chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. This review focuses on the
interest of use curcumin in cancer therapy by acting on the WNT/β-catenin pathway
to repress chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. In the cancer process, one 
of the major signaling pathways involved is the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which
appears to be upregulated. Curcumin administration participates to the
downregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and thus, through this action, in
tumor growth control. Curcumin act as PPARγ agonists. The WNT/β-catenin pathway
and PPARγ act in an opposed manner. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and
circadian clock disruption are common and co-substantial pathological processes
accompanying and promoting cancers. Circadian clock disruption related to the
upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway is involved in cancers. By stimulating 
PPARγ expression, curcumin can control circadian clocks through the regulation of
many key circadian genes. The administration of curcumin in cancer treatment
would thus appear to be an interesting therapeutic strategy, which acts through

was evaluated in mice by inducing diarrhea with castor oil. The extracts were

docking and dynamic simulation approaches revealed that oleacein could target the
binding site of the LSD1 cofactor flavin adenosine dinucleotide with high

predicted to target the interaction of LSD1 with histone H3 and the LSD1
co-repressor (RCOR1/CoREST), likely disturbing the anchorage of LSD1 to
chromatin. AlphaScreen-based in vitro assays confirmed the ability of oleacein to

Further, oleacein fully suppressed the expression of the transcription factor

distal enhancer. Conversely, oleacein failed to modify ectopic SOX2

mechanism of vasicinone against paraquat-induced cellular apoptosis in SH-SY5Y
cells. Vasicinone reduced the paraquat-induced loss of cell viability, rescued

species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis revealed that
vasicinone increased the phosphorylation of IGF1R/PI3K/AKT cell survival
signaling molecules and downregulated the paraquat-induced, mitogen-activated

depended critically on the activation of IGF1R, and the silencing of IGF1R by
siRNA completely abrogated the protective effect of vasicinone in SH-SY5Y cells.

threaten human health. Over the past decades, over 150 million humans have died
of CVDs. Hence, timely prediction of CVDs is especially important. Currently,
deep learning algorithm-based CVD diagnosis methods are extensively employed,
however, most such algorithms can only utilize one-lead ECGs. Hence, the
potential information in other-lead ECGs was not utilized. To address this issue,
we have developed novel methods for diagnosing arrhythmia. In this work,
DL-CCANet and TL-CCANet are proposed to extract abstract discriminating features 
from dual-lead and three-lead ECGs, respectively. Then, the linear support vector
machine specializing in high-dimensional features is used as the classifier
model. On the MIT-BIH database, a 95.2% overall accuracy is obtained by detecting
15 types of heartbeats using DL-CCANet. On the INCART database, overall
accuracies of 94.01% (II and V1 leads), 93.90% (V1 and V5 leads) and 94.07% (II
and V5 leads) are achieved by detecting seven types of heartbeat using DL-CCANet,
while TL-CCANet yields a higher overall accuracy of 95.52% using the above three 
leads. In addition, all of the above experiments are implemented using noisy ECG

haemophilia A is the development of anti-FVIII antibodies or inhibitors that
occur in 25%-30% of persons with severe haemophilia A. Alternative therapeutics
such as bypassing agents or immune tolerance induction protocols have additional 
challenges and are not always effective.
AIM: Assemble a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) State of the
Science (SOS) Workshop to generate a national blueprint for research on
inhibitors to solve the problem of FVIII immunogenicity.
METHODS: An Executive Steering Committee was formed in October 2017 to establish 
the scientific focus and Scientific Working Groups for the SOS Workshop in May
2018. Four working groups were assembled to address scientific priorities in
basic, translational and clinical research on inhibitors.
RESULTS: Working Group 1 was charged with determining the scientific priorities
for clinical trials to include the integration of non-intravenous, non-factor
therapeutics including gene therapy into the standard of care for people with
haemophilia A with inhibitors. Working Group 2 established the scientific
priorities for 21st-century data science and biospecimen collection for
observational inhibitor cohort studies. The scientific priorities for acquiring
an actionable understanding of FVIII immunogenicity and the immunology of the
host response and FVIII tolerance were developed by Working Group 3. Working
Group 4 designed prospective pregnancy/birth cohorts to study FVIII
immunogenicity, inhibitor development and eradication.
CONCLUSION: The NHLBI SOS Workshop generated a focused summary of scientific
priorities and implementation strategies to overcome the challenges of
eradicating and preventing inhibitors in haemophilia A.

distinctive mechanism responsible for the VSD-pore coupling at the AO state that 
is sensitive to ML277 modulation. ML277 provides insights and a tool to
investigate the gating mechanism of KCNQ1 channels, and our study reveals a new

functional annotation data is providing unique opportunities to incorporate prior
information into the analysis of GWAS to better understand the impact of variants
on disease etiology. Although there have been many advances in incorporating
prior information into prioritization of trait-associated variants in GWAS,
functional annotation data have played a secondary role in the joint analysis of 
GWAS and molecular (i.e., expression) quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data in
assessing evidence for association. To address this, we develop a novel mediation
framework, iFunMed, to integrate GWAS and eQTL data with the utilization of
publicly available functional annotation data. iFunMed extends the scope of
standard mediation analysis by incorporating information from multiple genetic
variants at a time and leveraging variant-level summary statistics. Data-driven
computational experiments convey how informative annotations improve
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection performance while emphasizing
robustness of iFunMed to noninformative annotations. Application to Framingham

We sought to: (a) use regional analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

(b) Assess the association of regional CMR abnormalities with the combined
endpoint of death, heart transplantation (HT) and AE; and (c) use machine

METHODS: we included 76 patients with CS and CMR. We analyzed cine images to
determine regional longitudinal (LS) and radial strain (RS); and late gadolinium 
enhancement imaging to determine regional scar burden (%scar).
RESULTS: Patients with AVB (n = 7), compared with those without, had higher %scar
in the anterior (21.8 ± 27.4 vs 5.1 ± 8.9; P = 0.0005) and anteroseptal
(19.3 ± 24.5 vs 3.5 ± 5.5; P < .0001) walls. Patients with VA (n = 12), compared 
with those without, had higher %scar in the basal inferoseptum (20.4 ± 30.8 vs
8.3 ± 13.4; P = .03). During mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 3.3 years, four patients
died or underwent HT; eight had VA; and zero developed AVB. Multiple regional
abnormalities were associated with the combined endpoint, including scar in the
anteroseptal wall (HR 1.06 [1.02-1.09] per 1%scar increase, P = .002). The ML
algorithm predicted the combined endpoint with a C-statistic of 0.91.
CONCLUSION: Regional CMR abnormalities are associated with AE in patients with
CS.

rather than ethnicity or race. We compared the extent to which variation in blood
pressure response across different ethnicities may be explained by genetic
factors: genetically defined ancestry and gene variants at loci known to be
associated with blood pressure. We analyzed data from 5 trials in which
genotyping had been performed (n=4696) and in which treatment responses to
β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor

in response to the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the β-blockers atenolol

angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan were more closely associated to
genetically defined ancestry than self-defined ethnicity in admixed subjects. A
relatively small number of gene variants related to loci associated with
drug-signaling pathways (KCNK3, SULT1C3, AMH, PDE3A, PLCE1, PRKAG2) with large

transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experience high rates of mortality. 
To date, risk scores for clinical deterioration applied to the acute care wards
rely on static or intermittent inputs of vital sign and assessment parameters. We
propose the use of continuous predictive analytics monitoring, or data that
relies on real-time physiologic monitoring data captured from ECG, documented
vital signs, laboratory results, and other clinical assessments to predict
clinical deterioration. A necessary step in translation to practice is
understanding how an alert threshold would perform if applied to a continuous
predictive analytic that was trained to detect clinical deterioration. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value of 'risk
spikes', or large abrupt increases in the output of a statistical model of risk
predicting clinical deterioration. We studied 8111 consecutive patient admissions
to a cardiovascular medicine and surgery ward with continuous ECG data. We first 
trained a multivariable logistic regression model for emergent ICU transfer in a 
test set and tested the characteristics of the model in a validation set of 4059 
patient admissions. Then, in a nested analysis we identified large, abrupt spikes
in risk (increase by three units over the prior 6 h; a unit is the fold-increase 
in risk of ICU transfer in the next 24 h) and reviewed hospital records of 91
patients for clinical events such as emergent ICU transfer. We compared results
to 59 control patients at times when they were matched for baseline risk
including the National Warning Score (NEWS). There was a 3.4-fold higher event
rate for patients with risk spikes (positive predictive value 24% compared to 7%,
p = 0.006). If we were to use risk spikes as an alert, they would fire about once
per day on a 73-bed acute care ward. Risk spikes that were primarily driven by
respiratory changes (ECG-derived respiration (EDR) or charted respiratory rate)
had highest PPV (30-35%) while risk spikes driven by heart rate had the lowest
(7%). Alert thresholds derived from continuous predictive analytics monitoring
are able to be operationalized as a degree of change from the person's own
baseline rather than arbitrary threshold cut-points, which can likely better
account for the individual's own inherent acuity levels. Point of care clinicians
in the acute care ward settings need tailored alert strategies that promote a
balance in recognition of clinical deterioration and assessment of the utility of
the alert approach.",Captcha,NaN

function analysis from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), including comprehensive 
quality control (QC) algorithms to detect erroneous output.
BACKGROUND: Analysis of cine CMR imaging using deep learning (DL) algorithms
could automate ventricular function assessment. However, variable image quality, 
variability in phenotypes of disease, and unavoidable weaknesses in training of
DL algorithms currently prevent their use in clinical practice.
METHODS: The framework consists of a pre-analysis DL image QC, followed by a DL
algorithm for biventricular segmentation in long-axis and short-axis views,
myocardial feature-tracking (FT), and a post-analysis QC to detect erroneous
results. The study validated the framework in healthy subjects and cardiac
patients by comparison against manual analysis (n = 100) and evaluation of the QC
steps' ability to detect erroneous results (n = 700). Next, this method was used 
to obtain reference values for cardiac function metrics from the UK Biobank.
RESULTS: Automated analysis correlated highly with manual analysis for left and
right ventricular volumes (all r > 0.95), strain (circumferential r = 0.89,
longitudinal r > 0.89), and filling and ejection rates (all r ≥ 0.93). There was 
no significant bias for cardiac volumes and filling and ejection rates, except
for right ventricular end-systolic volume (bias +1.80 ml; p = 0.01). The bias for
FT strain was <1.3%. The sensitivity of detection of erroneous output was 95% for
volume-derived parameters and 93% for FT strain. Finally, reference values were
automatically derived from 2,029 CMR exams in healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates a DL-based framework for automated,
quality-controlled characterization of cardiac function from cine CMR, without
the need for direct clinician oversight.

closely correlated with the index of arterial stiffness, AI (r = 0.76, p < 0.001)

saline contrast entry into, and exit from the left heart are significantly
different in intra- and extra-cardiac shunts and can be used to differentiate the
shunt mechanism when Valsalva manoeuvre cannot be performed, or is of uncertain
quality. We propose a novel approach of mapping the temporal changes in acoustic 
intensity (AI) within the left and right heart to identify and define these
unique patterns.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened cases of right to left shunting on resting
agitated saline contrast echocardiograms with clinical criteria that identified
the origin of shunting as either a patent foramen ovale or pulmonary
arteriovenous malformation. Acoustic time-intensity curves were generated from
the right and left heart chambers that reflected the change in saline contrast
density over time. Several novel pre-specified parameters were measured from
these curves, in addition to the standard heartbeat counting method, to
characterize the entrance (wash-in) and exit (wash-out) patterns of saline
contrast in the left heart. Statistical analysis showed that AI mapping provided 
superior differentiation of the two populations than did the traditional beat
counting method.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of shunt mechanism from saline contrast studies can be
improved over current methods through the use of AI mapping to define the
rapidity that peak contrast effect develops, the speed that the contrast effect
decays, and the contrast intensity late in the recording.

mortality worldwide and in low- and middle-income countries, and hypertension
(HTN) is a major risk factor for CVD. Although effective evidence-based
interventions for control of HTN in high-income countries exist, implementation
of these in low- and middle-income countries has been challenging due to limited 
capacity and infrastructure for late-phase translational research. In Rwanda, the
2015 STEPS NCD (STEPwise Approach to Surveillance of Noncommunicable Diseases)
risk survey reported an overall prevalence of HTN of 15% (95% confidence interval
[CI]: 13.8 to 16.3) for those ages 15 to 64 years; prevalence increased with
increasing age to 39% (95% CI: 35.7 to 43.1) for those ages 55 to 64 years; CVD
was the third most common cause of mortality (7%). Suboptimal infrastructure and 
capacity in Rwanda hinders research and community knowledge for HTN control.
OBJECTIVES: To address the issue of suboptimal capacity to implement
evidence-based interventions in HTN, this project was designed with the following
objectives: 1) to develop a regional needs assessment of infrastructure for
dissemination and implementation (D & I) strategies for HTN-CVD control; 2) to
develop HTN-CVD research capacity through creation of countrywide resources such 
as core research facilities and training in the fields of HTN-CVD, D & I, and
biostatistics; and 3) to engage and train multiple stakeholders in D & I and
HTN-CVD evidence-based interventions.
METHODS: A weeklong training program in HTN-CVD, biostatistics, and D & I was
conducted in Rwanda in August 2018, and pre- and post-D & I training competency
questionnaires were administered.
RESULTS: Questionnaire results show a statistically significant increase in D & I
knowledge and skills as a result of training (full scale pre- to post-test
scores: 2.12 ± 0.78 vs. 3.94 ± 0.42; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Using principles of community engagement and train-the-trainer
methods, we will continue to adapt guidelines and treatments for HTN-CVD
developed in high-income countries to the context of Rwanda with the goal of
establishing a sustainable platform to address the burden of disease from
HTN-CVD.

proposed network adds the temporal dimension by incorporating an optical flow
(OF) field to capture the cardiac motion. In addition, we introduce two
additional modules, a LV localization module and an attention module, that
provide improved LV detection and segmentation accuracy, respectively. We
evaluated OF-net on the public Cardiac Atlas database with multicenter cine MRI
data. The results showed that OF-net achieves an average perpendicular distance
(APD) of 0.90±0.08 pixels and a Dice index of 0.95±0.03 for LV segmentation in
the middle slices, outperforming the classical U-net model (APD 0.92±0.04 pixels,
Dice 0.94±0.16, p < 0.05). Specifically, the proposed method enhances the
temporal continuity of segmentation at the apical and basal slices, which are
typically more difficult to segment than middle slices. Our work exemplifies the 
ability of CNN to ""learn"" from expert experience when applied to specific
analysis tasks.

are based on the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however,
recent publications have suggested that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
(fNIRS), a relatively new technique, could be used to predict seizures. The
objectives of this research are to show that the application of fNIRS to
epileptic seizure detection yields results that are superior to those based on
EEG and to demonstrate that the application of deep learning to this problem is
suitable given the nature of fNIRS recordings. A Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) is applied to the prediction of epileptic seizures from fNIRS signals, an
optical modality for recording brain waves. The implementation of the proposed
method is presented in this work. Application of CNN to fNIRS recordings showed
an accuracy ranging between 96.9% and 100%, sensitivity between 95.24% and 100%, 
specificity between 98.57% and 100%, a positive predictive value between 98.52%
and 100%, and a negative predictive value between 95.39% and 100%. The most
important aspect of this research is the combination of fNIRS signals with the
particular CNN algorithm. The fNIRS modality has not been used in epileptic
seizure prediction. A CNN is suitable for this application because fNIRS
recordings are high dimensional data and they can be modeled as three-dimensional
tensors for classification.

intake and weight status, but little is known about feeding practices in Asian
countries. This study used behavioral observation to explore the feeding
practices of 201 mothers of 4.5 year-old children in Singapore during an ad
libitum buffet lunch. Feeding practices were coded from videos, focusing on
behaviors used to prompt the child to eat more food (autonomy-supportive and
coercive-controlling prompts to eat, suggesting items from buffet), those to
reduce intake (restriction, questioning food choice), and those related to eating
rate (hurrying or slowing child eating). Child outcome measures included energy
consumed, variety of food items selected, and BMI. Maternal restriction and
trying to slow child eating rate were associated with higher energy consumed by
the child (r = 0.19 and 0.13, respectively; p < 0.05). Maternal
autonomy-supportive prompts and restriction were associated with a greater
variety of items selected by children (r = 0.19 and 0.15, respectively;
p < 0.05). The frequency of maternal feeding practice use differed across ethnic 
groups, with Malay mothers using the most prompts to eat (p < 0.05), Chinese
mothers most likely to question a child's food choice (p < 0.01), and Indian
mothers the last likely to tell the child to eat faster (p < 0.001). There were
no differences between ethnic groups for other feeding practices. No associations
were found between feeding practices and child BMI. It is possible that feeding
practices related to restriction and slowing child eating are adopted in response
to children who consume larger portions, although longitudinal or intervention
studies are needed to confirm the direction of this relationship and create local
recommendations.

essential task. Currently, visual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) is
one of the main modality used in outcome prediction. There is a growing interest 
in computer-assisted EEG interpretation, either to overcome the possible
subjectivity of visual interpretation, or to identify complex features of the EEG
signal. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict
functional outcome based on 19-channel-EEG recorded from 267 adult comatose
patients during targeted temperature management after CA. The area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set was 0.885.
Interestingly, model architecture and fine-tuning only played a marginal role in 
classification performance. We then used gradient-weighted class activation
mapping (Grad-CAM) as visualization technique to identify which EEG features were
used by the network to classify an EEG epoch as favorable or unfavorable outcome,
and also to understand failures of the network. Grad-CAM showed that the network 
relied on similar features than classical visual analysis for predicting
unfavorable outcome (suppressed background, epileptiform transients). This study 
confirms that CNNs are promising models for EEG-based prognostication in comatose
patients, and that Grad-CAM can provide explanation for the models'
decision-making, which is of utmost importance for future use of deep learning
models in a clinical setting.

medicine and may also provide information about longevity and prognosis.
Objective: To develop and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) (named
CXR-risk) to predict long-term mortality, including noncancer death, from chest
radiographs.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, CXR-risk CNN
development (n = 41 856) and testing (n = 10 464) used data from the screening
radiography arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial (PLCO) (n = 52 320), a community cohort of asymptomatic nonsmokers and
smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 10 US sites from November 8, 1993, through
July 2, 2001. External testing used data from the screening radiography arm of
the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (n = 5493), a community cohort of heavy 
smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 21 US sites from August 2002, through
April 2004. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to May 23, 2019.
Exposure: Deep learning CXR-risk score (very low, low, moderate, high, and very
high) based on CNN analysis of the enrollment radiograph.
Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Prognostic value was assessed in
the context of radiologists' diagnostic findings (eg, lung nodule) and standard
risk factors (eg, age, sex, and diabetes) and for cause-specific mortality.
Results: Among 10 464 PLCO participants (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [5.4] years; 5405
men [51.6%]; median follow-up, 12.2 years [interquartile range, 10.5-12.9 years])
and 5493 NLST test participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [5.0] years; 3037 men
[55.3%]; median follow-up, 6.3 years [interquartile range, 6.0-6.7 years]), there
was a graded association between CXR-risk score and mortality. The very high-risk
group had mortality of 53.0% (PLCO) and 33.9% (NLST), which was higher compared
with the very low-risk group (PLCO: unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.3 [95% CI,
14.5-23.2]; NLST: unadjusted HR, 15.2 [95% CI, 9.2-25.3]; both P < .001). This
association was robust to adjustment for radiologists' findings and risk factors 
(PLCO: adjusted HR [aHR], 4.8 [95% CI, 3.6-6.4]; NLST: aHR, 7.0 [95% CI,
4.0-12.1]; both P < .001). Comparable results were seen for lung cancer death
(PLCO: aHR, 11.1 [95% CI, 4.4-27.8]; NLST: aHR, 8.4 [95% CI, 2.5-28.0]; both
P ≤ .001) and for noncancer cardiovascular death (PLCO: aHR, 3.6 [95% CI,
2.1-6.2]; NLST: aHR, 47.8 [95% CI, 6.1-374.9]; both P < .001) and respiratory
death (PLCO: aHR, 27.5 [95% CI, 7.7-97.8]; NLST: aHR, 31.9 [95% CI, 3.9-263.5];
both P ≤ .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the deep learning CXR-risk score
stratified the risk of long-term mortality based on a single chest radiograph.
Individuals at high risk of mortality may benefit from prevention, screening, and
lifestyle interventions.",Captcha,NaN
