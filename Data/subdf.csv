which patients might benefit most from certain therapies, and is relevant to
payers' demands to justify clinical and economic value. To understand the
robustness of risk prediction models for heart failure (HF), we conducted a
systematic literature review to (1) identify HF risk-prediction models, (2)
assess statistical approach and extent of validation, (3) identify common
variables, and (4) assess risk of bias (ROB).
METHODS: Literature databases were searched from March 2013 to May 2018 to
identify risk prediction models conducted in an out-of-hospital setting in adults
with HF. Distinct risk prediction variables were ranked according to outcomes
assessed and incorporation into the studies. ROB was assessed using Prediction
model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST).
RESULTS: Of 4720 non-duplicated citations, 40 risk-prediction publications were
deemed relevant. Within the 40 publications, 58 models assessed 55 (co)primary
outcomes, including all-cause mortality (n = 17), cardiovascular death (n = 9),
HF hospitalizations (n = 15), and composite endpoints (n = 14). Few publications 
reported detail on handling missing data (n = 11; 28%). The discriminatory
ability for predicting all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and composite
endpoints was generally better than for HF hospitalization. 105 distinct
predictor variables were identified. Predictors included in >5 publications were:
N-terminal prohormone brain-natriuretic peptide, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,
systolic blood pressure, sodium, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction, 
heart rate, and characteristics including male sex, diabetes, age, and BMI. Only 
11/58 (19%) models had overall low ROB, based on our application of PROBAST. In
total, 26/58 (45%) models discussed internal validation, and 14/58 (24%) external
validation.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the 58 identified risk-prediction models for HF
present particular concerns according to ROB assessment, mainly due to lack of
validation and calibration. The potential utility of novel approaches such as
machine learning tools is yet to be determined.

an essential component of the interventional cardiology toolbox. However, despite
long-term data demonstrating improved outcomes, physiology-guided percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) remains underutilized in current practice. This
review outlines the indications and technical aspects involved in evaluating
coronary stenosis physiology, focusing on the latest developments in the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: Beyond fractional flow reserve (FFR), non-hyperemic pressure
ratios (NHPR) that assess coronary physiology at rest without hyperemia now
abound. Additional advances in other alternative FFR approaches, including
non-invasive coronary CT (FFRCT), invasive angiography (FFRangio), and optical
coherence tomography (FFROCT), are being realized. Artificial intelligence
algorithms and robust tools that enable detailed pre-procedure ""virtual""
intervention are also emerging. The benefits of coronary physiological assessment
to determine lesion functional significance are well established. In addition to 
stable CAD, coronary physiology can be especially helpful in clinical scenarios
such as left main and multivessel CAD, serial lesions, non-infarct-related
arteries in acute coronary syndromes, and residual ischemia post-PCI. Today,
coronary physiological assessment remains an indispensable tool in the
catheterization laboratory, with an exciting technological future that will
further refine clinical practice and improve patient care.","Chowdhury M, Osborn EA.","Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine. doi: 10.1007/s11936-020-0803-7.

While the most well-known findings in human infection involve the central nervous
system, WNV can also cause significant lesions in the heart, kidneys and eyes.
Time has also revealed chronic neurologic sequelae related to prior human WNV
infection. Similarly, neurologic disease is a prominent manifestation of WNV
infection in most non-human non-host animals. However, in some avian species,

biological discovery, but the complex nature of the resulting datasets makes it
challenging to perform comprehensive analysis. One particular challenge is the
analysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell

unique pathophysiological processes of asthma across tissues. Using the top 100
asthma-associated methylation markers as classifiers from each dataset, we found 
that both AEC- and NEC-based DNAm signatures exerted a lower classification error
than the PBMC-based DNAm markers (p-value = 0.0002). The area-under-the-curve

subset of tissue-specific markers, respectively. We also discovered the
locus-locus interaction of DNAm levels of the CDH6 gene and RAPGEF3 gene might
interact with each other to jointly predict the risk of asthma - which suggests
the pivotal role of cell-cell junction in the pathological changes of asthma.

toxicity and overall survival (OS) for patients with locally advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, radiation-induced cardiac toxicity
among patients with early-stage NSCLC who have undergone stereotactic ablative
radiotherapy (SABR) has been less well-characterized. Our objective was to assess
the associations between cardiac radiation dosimetry and OS in patients with
early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, 153 patients with early-stage NSCLC had
undergone SABR at a single institution. The maximum dose, mean dose, V10Gy,
V25Gy, and V50Gy to 15 cardiac substructures and the whole heart were analyzed
for their association with OS using the Kaplan-Meier method. An artificial neural
network (ANN) analysis was performed to modulate confounding behaviors of
dosimetric variables to predict for OS.
RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included in the present analysis. The right
ventricle (RV) V10Gy most negatively predicted for OS, such that patients who had
received a RV V10Gy dose < 4% had significantly longer OS than patients who had
received a RV V10Gy does > 4% (5.3 years vs. 2.4 years). On ANN analysis, 74
input features, including cardiac dosimetry parameters, predicted for survival
with a test accuracy of 64.7%. A repeat ANN analysis using dosimetry to dose
neutral structure confirmed the predictive power of cardiac dosimetry.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac dosimetry to subvolumes of the heart was associated with
decreased OS in patients with early-stage NSCLC undergoing SABR. These data
support the importance of minimizing the radiation dose to cardiac substructures.
Further prioritizing the heart as an organ at risk might be warranted.
Additionally, cardiac follow-up should be considered.

information related to HF; this study is therefore based on the analysis of HS
signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of

was adopted to segment HS frames. Normalized frames were taken as the input of
the proposed model which can automatically learn the deep features and complete
the HF screening without de-nosing and hand-crafted feature extraction.
RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of proposed model, three methods are used
for comparison. The results show that the GRU model gives a satisfactory
performance with average accuracy of 98.82%, which is better than other

CONCLUSION: The proposed GRU model can learn features from HS directly, which
means it can be independent of expert knowledge. In addition, the good

improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment. We explored here how
unsupervised data-driven metabolic subgrouping, based on comprehensive
lipoprotein subclass data, would work in large-scale population cohorts.
METHODS: We applied a self-organizing map (SOM) artificial intelligence
methodology to define subgroups based on detailed lipoprotein profiles in a
population-based cohort (n = 5789) and utilised the trained SOM in an independent
cohort (n = 7607). We identified four SOM-based subgroups of individuals with
distinct lipoprotein profiles and CHD risk and compared those to univariate
subgrouping by apolipoprotein B quartiles.
RESULTS: The SOM-based subgroup with highest concentrations for non-HDL measures 
had the highest, and the subgroup with lowest concentrations, the lowest risk for
CHD. However, apolipoprotein B quartiles produced better resolution of risk than 
the SOM-based subgroups and also striking dose-response behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the majority of lipoprotein-mediated CHD 
risk is explained by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles.
Therefore, even advanced multivariate subgrouping, with comprehensive data on
lipoprotein metabolism, may not advance CHD risk assessment.

and experimental evidence has provided data on a major role of angiopoietin-like 
proteins 3 and 4 (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4) in regulating the activity of lipoprotein 
lipase (LPL), antagonizing the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG). Indeed, beyond
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ASCVD risk is also dependent on a
cluster of metabolic abnormalities characterized by elevated fasting and
post-prandial levels of TG-rich lipoproteins and their remnants. In a
head-to-head comparison between murine models for ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, the former
was found to be a better pharmacological target for the treatment of
hypertriglyceridemia. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 are
associated with a marked reduction of plasma levels of VLDL, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Carriers of
loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL4 show instead lower TG-rich lipoproteins and
a modest but significant increase of HDL. The relevance of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 as
new therapeutic targets is proven by the development of monoclonal antibodies or 
antisense oligonucleotides. Studies in animal models, including non-human
primates, have demonstrated that short-term treatment with monoclonal antibodies 
against ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 induces activation of LPL and a marked reduction of
plasma TG-rich-lipoproteins, apparently without any major side effects.
Inhibition of both targets also partially reduces LDL-C, independent of the LDL
receptor. Similar evidence has been observed with the antisense oligonucleotide
ANGPTL3-LRX. The genetic studies have paved the way for the development of new
ANGPTL3 and 4 antagonists for the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemias.
Conclusive data of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are still needed in order to
define their safety and efficacy profile.

and women in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC). The nutrition transition to 
diets high in salt, fat and sugar and low in fruit and vegetables, in parallel
with increasing prevalence of diet-related CVD risk factors in LMICs, identifies 
the need for urgent action to reverse this trend. To aid identification of the
most effective interventions it is crucial to understand whether there are sex
differences in dietary behaviours related to CVD risk.
METHODS: From a dataset of 46 nationally representative surveys, we included data
from seven countries that had recorded the same dietary behaviour measurements in
adults; Bhutan, Eswatini, Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Nepal and St Vincent and the
Grenadines (2013-2017). Three dietary behaviours were investigated: positive salt
use behaviour (SUB), meeting fruit and vegetable (F&V) recommendations and use of
vegetable oil rather than animal fats in cooking. Generalized linear models were 
used to investigate the association between dietary behaviours and waist
circumference (WC) and undiagnosed and diagnosed hypertension and diabetes.
Interaction terms between sex and dietary behaviour were added to test for sex
differences.
RESULTS: Twenty-four thousand three hundred thirty-two participants were
included. More females than males reported positive SUB (31.3 vs. 27.2% p-value
< 0.001), yet less met F&V recommendations (13.2 vs. 14.8%, p-value< 0.05). The
prevalence of reporting all three dietary behaviours in a positive manner was
2.7%, varying by country, but not sex. Poor SUB was associated with a higher
prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension for females (13.1% vs. 9.9%,
p-value = 0.04), and a higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for males (2.4% 
vs. 1.5%, p-value = 0.02). Meeting F&V recommendations was associated with a
higher prevalence of high WC (24.4% vs 22.6%, p-value = 0.01), but was not
associated with undiagnosed or diagnosed hypertension or diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to increase F&V intake and positive SUBs in the
included countries are urgently needed. Dietary behaviours were not notably
different between sexes. However, our findings were limited by the small
proportion of the population reporting positive dietary behaviours, and further
research is required to understand whether associations with CVD risk factors and
interactions by sex would change as the prevalence of positive behaviours
increases.","McKenzie BL, Santos JA, Geldsetzer P, Davies J, Manne-Goehler J, Gurung MS, Sturua L, Gathecha G, Aryal KK, Tsabedze L, Andall-Brereton G, Bärnighausen T, Atun R, Vollmer S, Woodward M, Jaacks LM, Webster J.",Nutrition journal. doi: 10.1186/s12937-019-0517-4.

STUDY DESIGN: randomised, single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
PATIENTS: 101 post-menopausal women were randomised (1:1:1) into one of three
groups taking daily 2.5mg tibolone, continuous oral oestradiol-17β 2mg plus
norethisterone acetate 1mg daily (E2 /NETA) or placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting serum lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein
concentrations measured at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment.
RESULTS: Both tibolone and E2 /NETA lowered plasma total cholesterol
concentrations relative to placebo. With tibolone, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced (-27% at 24 months, p<0.001), the greatest effect
being in the cholesterol-enriched HDL2 subfraction (-40%, p<0.001). Tibolone's
effect on HDL concentrations was also apparent in the principal HDL protein
component, apolipoprotein AI (-29% at 24 months, p<0.001). However, there was no 
significant effect of tibolone on low-density or very-low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C and VLDL-C, respectively). By contrast, the greatest reduction
in cholesterol with E2 /NETA was in LDL-C (-22% at 24 months, p=0.008). E2 /NETA 
reduced HDL-C to a lesser extent than tibolone (-12% at 24 months, p<0.001).
Effects on HDL apolipoproteins were similarly diminished relative to tibolone. E2
/NETA had no effect on VLDL-C or on the protein component of LDL, apolipoprotein 
B.
CONCLUSION: Tibolone reduces serum HDL. E2 /NETA reduces LDL cholesterol but not 
apolipoprotein B, suggesting decreased cholesterol loading of LDL. Any impact
these changes may have on CVD risk needs further investigation.

RECENT FINDINGS: In 2013, The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College
of Cardiology (ACC) assigned an ejection fraction (EF) range to heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF ≤ 40%) and heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF ≥50%). This classification created a ""gray zone"" of 
patients with EFs between 41% and 49% that ultimately came to be known as heart
failure with borderline or mid-range ejection fraction. HFmrEF patients represent
a group with heterogeneous clinical characteristics that at times resembles
HFrEF, at others HFpEF, and at others still a unique phenotype altogether. No
randomized controlled trials exist in those with HFmrEF, though HFrEF and HFpEF
studies that include overlap suggest some potential benefit of beta blockers,
angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors. Mortality rates among the HFmrEF
population are significant, and are similar to those in patients with HFrEF and
HFpEF. HFmrEF is a complex disorder that remains poorly understood. Future
research is needed to better elucidate the pathophysiology, management, and

measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), particularly when this

arteries prediction and damage in CHD and may be also used in cerebrovascular and
renal circulations models. PWV index determinations are particularly relevant to 
consider in angiographic CHD decisions and in the presence of vulnerable plaques 
with high cardiovascular risk. Due to the variability in symptoms and clinical
characteristics of patients, together with some imperfections in results, there
is no very simple adequate diagnosis approach enabling to improve the so defined

has substantially decreased, but post-AMI cardiac remodeling remains an important
factor affecting patient prognosis. Several circulating long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are reportedly involved in the chronic pathological process of cardiac 
function and remodeling in cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential roles

METHODS: Fifty-three patients with AMI and 90 controls without AMI were
consecutively enrolled in this study. Clinical parameters and blood samples at
different time points (i.e., 24 h and 3 days) were collected.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the circulating levels of cardiac
hypertrophy-associated transcript (CHAST) significantly increased in AMI
patients, and the CHAST levels obviously decreased at 3 days. In AMI patients,
the expression levels of CHAST at 24 h were positively associated with cardiac
contractile function and measured as left ventricular ejection fraction and left 
ventricular short-axis shortening rate (all P < 0.050). Multivariate regression
analysis indicated that the expression level of CHAST at 24 h was an independent 
predictor of cardiac contractile function (standardized β = 0.319, P =0.034).
When grouped according to the quartile values of the CHAST in the AMI population,
patients with the highest quartiles of CHAST expression level showed better
cardiac contractile function than all the other quartiles (all P < 0.050).
CONCLUSION: CHAST was an independent predictor of cardiac contractile function at
early-stage AMI and may serve as a candidate biomarker for cardiac remodeling.

Different
clinical phenotypes for food allergy are likely to exist, in much the same way as
endotype discovery is now a major research theme in asthma. We discuss the
emerging evidence for different reaction phenotypes i.e. symptoms experienced
following allergen exposure in food-allergic individuals, and their relevance for
clinical practice.
DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished literature relating to reaction
phenotypes in food allergy. Study Selections Authors assessment of the available 
data.
RESULTS: Food anaphylaxis may have a different pathophysiology to anaphylaxis
caused by nonfood triggers. Currently, there are no robust, clinically useful
predictors of severity in food allergy. It is likely that patient-specific
reaction phenotypes exist in food allergy, which may impact upon risk of severe
anaphylaxis. Allergen immunotherapy may modulate these phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Data are emerging to confirm our clinical experience that many
food-allergic patients experience stereotypical symptoms following allergen
exposure, both in the community and at supervised oral food challenge, in a
manner that varies from one patient to another. Integrating datasets from
different cohorts and applying unbiased machine-learning analyses may demonstrate
specific food allergy endotypes, in a similar way to asthma. Whether this results
in improvements in patient management (e.g. through facilitating risk
stratification or impacting on the decision to prescribe EAI and, perhaps, the
number of devices) remains to be determined - but given our current inability to 
predict patients most at risk of severe food-allergic reactions, this will
clearly be an important area of research in the future.

parameters of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Multiple ML models were trained on a retrospective database 
of 1510 patients undergoing CRT implantation to predict 1- to 5-year all-cause
mortality. Thirty-three pre-implant clinical features were selected to train the 
models. The best performing model [SEMMELWEIS-CRT score (perSonalizEd assessMent 
of estiMatEd risk of mortaLity With machinE learnIng in patientS undergoing CRT
implantation)], along with pre-existing scores (Seattle Heart Failure Model,
VALID-CRT, EAARN, ScREEN, and CRT-score), was tested on an independent cohort of 
158 patients. There were 805 (53%) deaths in the training cohort and 80 (51%)
deaths in the test cohort during the 5-year follow-up period. Among the trained
classifiers, random forest demonstrated the best performance. For the prediction 
of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year mortality, the areas under the receiver operating
characteristic curves of the SEMMELWEIS-CRT score were 0.768 (95% CI:
0.674-0.861; P < 0.001), 0.793 (95% CI: 0.718-0.867; P < 0.001), 0.785 (95% CI:
0.711-0.859; P < 0.001), 0.776 (95% CI: 0.703-0.849; P < 0.001), and 0.803 (95%
CI: 0.733-0.872; P < 0.001), respectively. The discriminative ability of our
model was superior to other evaluated scores.
CONCLUSION: The SEMMELWEIS-CRT score (available at semmelweiscrtscore.com)
exhibited good discriminative capabilities for the prediction of all-cause death 
in CRT patients and outperformed the already existing risk scores. By capturing
the non-linear association of predictors, the utilization of ML approaches may
facilitate optimal candidate selection and prognostication of patients undergoing
CRT implantation.

automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more
emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more 
likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the
temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method
efficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and
fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet

the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms

(T2DM) prognosis. This multicenter study aimed to investigate blood glucose
control among patients with insulin-treated T2DM in North China and explore the
application value of combining an elastic network (EN) with a machine-learning
algorithm to predict glycemic control.
METHODS: Basic information, biochemical indices, and diabetes-related data were
collected via questionnaire from 2787 consecutive participants recruited from 27 
centers in six cities between January 2016 and December 2017. An EN regression
was used to address variable collinearity. Then, three common machine learning
algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and back
propagation artificial neural network [BP-ANN]) were used to simulate and predict
blood glucose status. Additionally, a stepwise logistic regression was performed 
to compare the machine learning models.
RESULTS: The well-controlled blood glucose rate was 45.82% in North China. The
multivariable analysis found that hypertension history, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease history, exercise, and total cholesterol were protective
factors in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control, while central adiposity,
family history, T2DM duration, complications, insulin dose, blood pressure, and
hypertension were risk factors for elevated HbA1c. Before the dimensional
reduction in the EN, the areas under the curve of RF, SVM, and BP were 0.73,
0.61, and 0.70, respectively, while these figures increased to 0.75, 0.72, and
0.72, respectively, after dimensional reduction. Moreover, the EN and machine
learning models had higher sensitivity and accuracy than the logistic regression 
models (the sensitivity and accuracy of logistic were 0.52 and 0.56; RF: 0.79,
0.70; SVM: 0.84, 0.73; BP-ANN: 0.78, 0.73, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of T2DM patients in North China had poor glycemic
control and were at a higher risk of developing diabetic complications. The EN
and machine learning algorithms are alternative choices, in addition to the
traditional logistic model, for building predictive models of blood glucose
control in patients with T2DM.","Wang J, Wang MY, Wang H, Liu HW, Lu R, Duan TQ, Li CP, Cui Z, Liu YY, Lyu YJ, Ma J.",Chinese medical journal. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000585.

critical to deploy targeted interventions aimed at improving patients' quality of

Objectives: To compare machine learning approaches with traditional logistic
regression in predicting key outcomes in patients with HF and evaluate the added 
value of augmenting claims-based predictive models with electronic medical record
(EMR)-derived information.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A prognostic study with a 1-year follow-up
period was conducted including 9502 Medicare-enrolled patients with HF from 2
health care provider networks in Boston, Massachusetts (""providers"" includes
physicians, clinicians, other health care professionals, and their institutions
that comprise the networks). The study was performed from January 1, 2007, to
December 31, 2014; data were analyzed from January 1 to December 31, 2018.
Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, top cost
decile, and home days loss greater than 25% were modeled using logistic
regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operation regression,
classification and regression trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted
modeling (GBM). All models were trained using data from network 1 and tested in
network 2. After selecting the most efficient modeling approach based on
discrimination, Brier score, and calibration, area under precision-recall curves 
(AUPRCs) and net benefit estimates from decision curves were calculated to focus 
on the differences when using claims-only vs claims + EMR predictors.
Results: A total of 9502 patients with HF with a mean (SD) age of 78 (8) years
were included: 6113 from network 1 (training set) and 3389 from network 2
(testing set). Gradient-boosted modeling consistently provided the highest
discrimination, lowest Brier scores, and good calibration across all 4 outcomes; 
however, logistic regression had generally similar performance (C statistics for 
logistic regression based on claims-only predictors: mortality, 0.724; 95% CI,
0.705-0.744; HF hospitalization, 0.707; 95% CI, 0.676-0.737; high cost, 0.734;
95% CI, 0.703-0.764; and home days loss claims only, 0.781; 95% CI, 0.764-0.798;

0.745; 95% CI, 0.718-0.772; high cost, 0.733; 95% CI, 0.703-0.763; and home days 
loss, 0.790; 95% CI, 0.773-0.807). Higher AUPRCs were obtained for claims + EMR
vs claims-only GBMs predicting mortality (0.484 vs 0.423), HF hospitalization
(0.413 vs 0.403), and home time loss (0.575 vs 0.521) but not cost (0.249 vs
0.252). The net benefit for claims + EMR vs claims-only GBMs was higher at
various threshold probabilities for mortality and home time loss outcomes but
similar for the other 2 outcomes.
Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning methods offered only limited
improvement over traditional logistic regression in predicting key HF outcomes.

improve prediction for some, but not all, outcomes.","Desai RJ, Wang SV, Vaduganathan M, Evers T, Schneeweiss S.",JAMA network open. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.18962.

cardiovascular and kidney diseases; hereafter referred to as HND (heart/cardiac-,
nephrology-, diabetes mellitus-) patients, are high utilizers of health care.
However, the care received is often insufficiently coordinated between different 
specialties and health-care providers. This study aims to describe the
characteristics of HND patients and to explore the initial effects of a
multidisciplinary and person-centered care on total care utilization.
Patients and Methods: We conducted a sub-study of HND patients recruited in an
ongoing randomized trial CareHND (NCT03362983). Descriptive statistics of patient
characteristics, including diagnostic data and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores,
informed a comparison of care utilization patterns between HND patient care and
traditional care. Diagnostic and care utilization data were collected from a
regional database. Wilcoxon signed ranked sum tests were performed to compare
care utilization frequencies between the two groups.
Results: Patients included in the study were care-intensive with several
diagnoses and experienced a high level of variation in care utilization and
diagnoses profiles. HND patients were sicker than their counterparts in the
control group. Utilization indicators were similar between the two arms. There
was some indication that the HND center is beginning to perform as expected, but 
no results were statistically significant.
Conclusion: This study sits among many studies reporting difficulties obtaining
statistically significant findings for MCC patients. However, previous research
has shown that the key components of this intervention, such as integrated,
multidisciplinary, inter-professional collaboration within patient-centered care 
have had a positive effect on health-care outcomes. More innovative methods
beyond the RCT, such as machine learning should be explored to evaluate the
impact of integrated care interventions on care utilization.

Characterizing T-wave morphology might improve LQTS diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To improve LQTS diagnosis by combining new polynomial-based T-wave
morphology parameters with the corrected QT-interval (QTc), age and sex in a
model.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort consisting of 333 LQTS patients and 345
genotype-negative family members was used in this study. For each patient, a
linear combination of the first 2 Hermite-Gauss (HG) polynomials was fitted to
the STT-segments of an average complex of all precordial leads and limb leads I
and II. The weight coefficients as well as the error of the best fit were used to
characterize T-wave morphology. Subjects were classified as LQTS or controls by
clinical QTc cut-offs and three support-vector-machine (SVM) models fed with
different features. An external cohort consisting of 72 patients and 45 controls 
was finally used to check the robustness of the models.
RESULTS: Baseline QTc cut-offs were specific but had low sensitivity in
diagnosing LQTS. The model with T-wave morphology features, QTc, age and sex had 
the best overall accuracy (84%) followed by a model with QTc, age and sex (79%). 
The Extended model especially performed better in LQT-3 patients (69%).
CONCLUSION: T-wave morphologies can be characterized by fitting a linear
combination of the first 2 HG-polynomials. Adding T-wave morphology
characterizations to age, gender and QTc in an SVM-model improves LQTS diagnosis.

Guidelines for the management of heart failure (HF) was released. The aim of this
study was to describe the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction after

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Linx registry is a multicentre, observational,
cross-sectional study from 14 Catalan hospitals that enrolled 1056 patients with 
HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%) from 1 February to 30
April 2017 in outpatient cardiology clinics. Results were compared between
hospitals according to their level of complexity in our own registry and compared
with previously published registries similar to ours. Sacubitril/valsartan was
prescribed to 23.9% of patients in our population, as a consequence, use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers in
monotherapy decreased to 48.1% and 16.9%, respectively, and prescription of
beta-blockers (91.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (72.7%), and
ivabradine (21.4%) remained similar to previous registries. Target doses of
beta-blockers (25.4%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (24.9%),
angiotensin receptor blockers (7.7%), sacubitril/valsartan (8.1%), and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (19.7%) were accomplished in a low
proportion of patients. Our results also suggest that prescription and
up-titration of class I HF drugs were greater in hospitals with higher level of
complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: The Linx registry shows an appropriate adherence to pharmacological 
recommendations from ESC HF Guidelines despite a low proportion of patients
reached target doses. Almost one-quarter of patients were under treatment with

albuminuria translates into a decreased occurrence of cardiovascular and renal
outcomes.
AIMS: To evaluate the changes in the prevalence of albuminuria in diabetic
hypertensive patients treated with several combinations of renin-angiotensin
aldosterone system with calcium channel blockers.
METHODS: We analysed data from 668 unselected patients from the PAIT survey (mean
age 60.4 ± 10.2 years, prevalence of males 38%), with and without albuminuria,
maintained for 6 months with the previous treatment with amlodipine-valsartan,
amlodipine perindopril, lercanidipine-enalapril, verapamil-trandolapril,
nitrendipine-enalapril and felodipine-ramipril Albuminuria was assessed, as
urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, using a Multistic-Clinitek device analyzer.
Microalbuminuria was defined as a loss of 3.4-33.9 mg albumin/mmol creatinine
(30-300 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria as a loss of > 33.9 mg albumin/mmol creatinine
(> 300 mg/g). Blood pressure was measured with a validated digital device.
RESULTS: At baseline, albuminuria was present in 310 subjects (46.4%)
(microalbuminuria in 263 (84.8%), macroalbuminuria in 15.2%), and
normoalbuminuria in 53.6% 358. After 6 months, the prevalence of subjects with
albuminuria was significantly lowered (p < 0.01) by 23.5% (microalbuminuria
- 23.9%, p < 0.01 and macroalbuminuria - 21.3%). The prevalence of subjects with 
microalbuminuria was reduced with all treatments: amlodipine-valsartan - 15.6%,
amlodipine-perindopril - 11.8%, lercanidipine-enalapril - 41.3% and
verapamil-trandolapril - 19.2%. Data with nitrendipine-enalapril and

cardiovascular agents used in elderly people living in nursing homes between 2007
and 2013. Further, the aim was to analyse the use of cardiovascular drugs in
relation to cognitive impairment and associated factors within the same
population, where prescription of loop diuretics was used as a proxy for heart
failure.
METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were performed including 2494 people in 2007
and 1654 people in 2013 living in nursing homes in northern Sweden. Data were
collected concerning drug use, functioning in activities of daily living (ADL)
and cognition, using the Multi-Dimensional Dementia Assessment Scale (MDDAS). The
use of different drugs and drug classes among people at four different levels of 
cognitive function in 2007 and 2013 were compared.
RESULTS: The proportion of people prescribed ASA and diuretics was significantly 
lower at all four levels of cognitive function in 2013 compared to 2007. Among
people prescribed loop diuretics, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARBs) increased from 37.8 to
45.6%, β-blockers from 36.0 to 41.8% and warfarin from 4.4 to 11.4%. The use of
warfarin, ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)
were less common among individuals with more severe cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that cardiovascular drug treatment has improved 
between 2007 and 2013, but there is room for further improvement, especially
regarding adherence to guidelines for heart failure. Increasing cognitive
impairment had an effect on treatment patterns for heart failure and atrial
fibrillation.","Svahn S, Lövheim H, Isaksson U, Sandman PO, Gustafsson M.",European journal of clinical pharmacology. doi: 10.1007/s00228-019-02778-y.

protein glycosylation, which is a highly controlled ubiquitous posttranslational 
modification. Here we investigate the ability of the plasma N-glycome to predict 
incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; i.e., myocardial

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on the prospective European Prospective
Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort (n = 27,548), we constructed
case-cohorts including a random subsample of 2,500 participants and all
physician-verified incident cases of type 2 diabetes (n = 820; median follow-up
time 6.5 years) and CVD (n = 508; median follow-up time 8.2 years). Information
on the relative abundance of 39 N-glycan groups in baseline plasma samples was
generated by chromatographic profiling. We selected predictive N-glycans for type
2 diabetes and CVD separately, based on cross-validated machine learning,
nonlinear model building, and construction of weighted prediction scores. This
workflow for CVD was applied separately in men and women.
RESULTS: The N-glycan-based type 2 diabetes score was strongly predictive for
diabetes risk in an internal validation cohort (weighted C index 0.83, 95% CI
0.78-0.88), and this finding was externally validated in the Finland
Cardiovascular Risk Study (FINRISK) cohort. N-glycans were moderately predictive 
for CVD incidence (weighted C indices men: 0.66, 95% CI 0.60-0.72; women: 0.64,
95% CI 0.55-0.73). Information on the selected N-glycans improved the accuracy of
established and clinically applied risk prediction scores for type 2 diabetes and
CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: Selected N-glycans improve type 2 diabetes and CVD prediction beyond
established risk markers. Plasma protein N-glycan profiling may thus be useful
for risk stratification in the context of precisely targeted primary prevention
of cardiometabolic diseases.

1 (IGF1) is a key positive regulator of muscle mass. The IGF1/Igf1 gene encodes
multiple protein isoforms that differ in tissue expression, potency, and
function, particularly in cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as 
in systemic versus localized signaling. Genome engineering is a novel strategy
for increasing gene expression and has the potential to recapitulate the diverse 
biology seen in IGF1 signaling through the overexpression of multiple IGF1
isoforms. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene activation approach, we showed that the
expression of multiple IGF1 or Igf1 mRNA variants can be increased in human and
mouse skeletal muscle myoblast cell lines using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). We
found increased IGF1 protein levels in the cell culture media and increased
cellular phosphorylation of AKT1, the main effector of IGF1 signaling. We also
showed that the expression of Class 1 or Class 2 mRNA variants can be selectively
increased by changing the sgRNA target location. The expression of multiple IGF1 
or Igf1 mRNA transcript variants in human and mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts
promoted myotube differentiation and prevented dexamethasone-induced atrophy in
myotubes in vitro. Our findings suggest that this novel approach for enhancing
IGF1 signaling has potential therapeutic applications for treating skeletal

density lipoprotein particles (HDLs). We previously demonstrated that apo-AI
injected directly into high-fat diet fed mice improved insulin sensitivity
associated with decreased hepatic inflammation. While our data provides
compelling proof of concept, apoA-I mimetic peptides are more clinically
feasible. The aim of this study was to test whether apo-AI mimetic peptide (D-4F 
and L-5F) treatment will emulate the effects of full-length apo-AI to improve
insulin sensitivity.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks before receiving
D4F mimetic peptide administered via drinking water or L5F mimetic peptide
administered by intraperitoneal injection bi-weekly for a total of five weeks.
Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were conducted to assess the
effects of the peptides on insulin resistance. Effects of the peptides on
inflammation, gluconeogenic enzymes and lipid synthesis were assessed by
real-time PCR of key markers involved in the respective pathways.
RESULTS: Treatment with apo-AI mimetic peptides D-4F and L-5F showed: (i)
improved blood glucose clearance (D-4F 1.40-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD,
P<0.05; L-4F 1.17-fold AUC decrease compared to HFD, ns) in the glucose tolerance
test; (ii) improved insulin tolerance (D-4F 1.63-fold AUC decrease compared to
HFD, P<0.05; L-5F 1.39-fold AUC compared to HFD, P<0.05) in the insulin tolerance
test. The metabolic test results were associated with (i) decreased hepatic
inflammation of SAA1, IL-1β IFN-γ and TNFα (2.61-5.97-fold decrease compared to
HFD, P<0.05) for both mimetics; (ii) suppression of hepatic mRNA expression of
gluconeogenesis-associated genes (PEPCK and G6Pase; 1.66-3.01-fold decrease
compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics; (iii) lipogenic-associated genes,
(SREBP1c and ChREBP; 2.15-3.31-fold decrease compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both
mimetics and; (iv) reduced hepatic macrophage infiltration (F4/80 and CD68;
1.77-2.15-fold compared to HFD, P<0.001) for both mimetics.
CONCLUSION: Apo-AI mimetic peptides treatment led to improved glucose
homeostasis. This effect is associated with reduced expression of inflammatory
markers in the liver and reduced infiltration of macrophages, suggesting an
overall suppression of hepatic inflammation. We also showed altered expression of
genes associated with gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, suggesting that
glucose and lipid synthesis is suppressed. These findings suggest that apoA-I
mimetic peptides could be a new therapeutic option to reduce hepatic inflammation
that contributes to the development of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance.","McGrath KC, Li X, Twigg SM, Heather AK.",PloS one. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0226931.

heterogeneous syndrome. We aimed to derive HFpEF phenotype-based groups
('phenogroups') based on clinical and echocardiogram data using machine learning,

phenogroups.
METHODS: We applied model-based clustering to 32 echocardiogram and 11 clinical
and laboratory variables collected in stable condition from 320 HFpEF outpatients
in the Karolinska-Rennes cohort study (56% female, median 78 years (IQR: 71-83)).
Baseline proteomics and the composite end point of all-cause mortality or heart
failure (HF) hospitalisation were used in secondary analyses.
RESULTS: We identified six phenogroups, for which significant differences in the 
prevalence of concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF), anaemia and kidney disease
were observed (p<0.05). Fifteen out of 86 plasma proteins differed between
phenogroups (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05), including biomarkers of HF, AF and 
kidney function. The composite end point was significantly different between
phenogroups (log-rank p<0.001), at short-term (100 days), mid-term (18 months)
and longer-term follow-up (1000 days). Phenogroup 2 was older, with poorer
diastolic and right ventricular function and higher burden of risk factors as AF 
(85%), hypertension (83%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30%). In
this group a third experienced the primary outcome to 100 days, and two-thirds to
18 months (HR (95% CI) versus phenogroups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6: 1.5 (0.8-2.9); 5.7
(2.6-12.8); 2.9 (1.5-5.6); 2.7 (1.6-4.6); 2.1 (1.2-3.9)).
CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning we identified distinct HFpEF phenogroups with
differential characteristics and outcomes, as well as differential levels of
inflammatory and cardiovascular proteins.

involuntary movements of the fetus, the small size of the heart, and the lack of

that prednisone, fluticasone, budesonide, and progesterone each increased cAMP
levels within 3 minutes without phosphodiesterase inhibitors by measuring

knockdown of Gαs virtually eliminated glucocorticoid-stimulated cAMP responses,

receptor. Estradiol had small effects on cAMP levels but G protein estrogen
receptor antagonists had little effect on responses to any of the glucocorticoids
tested. The genomic and non-genomic actions of budesonide were analyzed by
RNA-Seq analysis of 24 hours treated HASM, with and without knockdown of Gαs . A 
140-gene budesonide signature was identified, of which 48 genes represent a
non-genomic signature that requires Gαs signaling. Collectively, this non-genomic
cAMP signaling modality contributes to one-third of the gene expression changes
induced by glucocorticoid treatment and shifts the view of how this important
class of drugs exerts its effects.

Previously, we identified Protein Kinase C-delta (PKCδ) as an important regulator
of the inflammatory response in sepsis. An important issue in development of
anti-inflammatory therapeutics is the risk of immunosuppression and inability to 
effectively clear pathogens. In this study, we investigated whether PKCδ
inhibition prevented organ dysfunction and improved survival without compromising
pathogen clearance. Sprague Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation 
and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Post-surgery, PBS or a PKCδ inhibitor
(200µg/kg) was administered intra-tracheally (IT). At 24 hours post-CLP, there
was evidence of lung and kidney dysfunction. PKCδ inhibition decreased leukocyte 
influx in these organs, decreased endothelial permeability, improved gas
exchange, and reduced blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios indicating organ
protection. PKCδ inhibition significantly decreased bacterial levels in the
peritoneal cavity, spleen and blood but did not exhibit direct bactericidal
properties. Peritoneal chemokine levels, neutrophil numbers, or macrophage
phenotypes were not altered by PKCδ inhibition. Peritoneal macrophages isolated
from PKCδ inhibitor-treated septic rats demonstrated increased bacterial
phagocytosis. Importantly, PKCδ inhibition increased survival. Thus, PKCδ
inhibition improved survival and improved survival was associated with increased 
phagocytic activity, enhanced pathogen clearance, and decreased organ injury.

The main goal of the heart failure treatment is the decrease of mortality and
morbidity, especially improvement of quality of life and decrease of
hospitalisations. ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of the treatment, MRA should
be added to ACEI. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are indicated in the case
of ACE inhibitors intolerance. Betablockers in maximal tolerated doses should be 
added to the renin angiotensin blockade. Diuretics are given to the symptoms
relieve - dyspnoe or oedema. Digoxin is indicated in selected patients. There are
3 new promising groups of drugs: (1) Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor - 
ARNI - Sacubitril/Valsartan can replace the ACEI according to the results of the 
PARADIGM-HF trial. (2) Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in
patients with diabetes mellitus. (3) A hughe clinical research is done with
omecamtiv mecarbil and others perspective drugs.

frequent cause of heart failure in Latin America. TNF-α+ monocytes/macrophages
(Mo/Mφ) are associated with inflammatory pathology in chronic CD. In this study, 
we determined the progenitor lineage of Mo/Mφ contributing to inflammation and
examined the regulatory role of SIRT1 in modulating the Mo/Mφ response in Chagas 
disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice were infected with Tc, treated with SIRT1
agonist (SRT1720) after control of acute parasitemia, and monitored during
chronic phase (150 days post-infection). Flow cytometry studies showed an
increase in maturation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived Mo of
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotype in acutely- and
chronically-infected mice; however, these cells were not increased in splenic
compartment of infected mice. Instead, yolk-sac-derived CD11b+ F4/80+ Mo/Mφ were 
increased in sinusoidal compartment of Chagas mice. The splenic CD11b+ F4/80+
Mo/Mφ of Chagas (vs. control) mice exhibited increased mRNA, protein, and surface
expression of markers of proinflammatory phenotype (CD80+/CD64+ > CD200+/CD206+) 
associated with proinflammatory cytokines response (IL-6+TNF-α >> Arg-1+IL-10),
and these were also detected in the myocardium of chronically infected mice.
Infected mice treated with SRT1720 (vs. infected/untreated) exhibited decreased
splenic expansion and myocardial infiltration of proinflammatory Mo/Mφ. SRT1720
did not alter the inherent capability of splenic Mo/Mφ of Chagas mice to respond 
to pathogen stimulus. Instead, SRT1720 dampened the Tc-induced increase in the
expression and/or phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and downstream
transcription factors (Pu.1, c-Myb, and Runx1) involved in Mφ proliferation and
migration and Notch1 involved in functional activation. Studies in cultured Mφ
confirmed the agonistic effects of SIRT1 in controlling the Tc-induced,
FAK-dependent increase in the expression of transcription factors and showed that
SIRT1 agonist and FAK inhibitor abrogated the NF-κB transcriptional activity and 
inflammatory cytokine gene expression in Tc-infected Mφ.
CONCLUSIONS: The proinflammatory Mo/Mφ of yolk sac origin drive the splenic and
tissue inflammatory response in chronic CD. SRT1720 reprogrammed the Tc-induced
FAK-dependent transcription factors involved in Mφ proliferation and
proinflammatory activation in Chagas disease.","Wan X, Chowdhury IH, Jie Z, Choudhuri S, Garg NJ.",Cells. pii: E80. doi: 10.3390/cells9010080. Journal Article.,Cells. 2019,PubMed,Journal Article,PMID:31905606,pubmed,31905606,create date: 2019/12/28 | first author: Wan X

have been associated with non-communicable disease (NCD) risk. We examined
whether prevalent mood disorders are associated with incident NCDs and
multimorbidity (accumulation of ≥2 NCDs) in PLWH.
SETTING: Adult HIV clinic cohort in Nashville, Tennessee, between 1998-2015.
METHODS: PLWH with ≥1 year of follow-up in the clinic were assessed for
cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome (any three of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or obesity), chronic kidney and liver disease,
non-AIDS-defining cancers, and dementia. Only mood disorders documented during
the first year of care were included. Cumulative incidence and adjusted subhazard
ratios were calculated for risk of NCDs and multimorbidity with death as a
competing risk. Multivariable Cox models estimated mortality risk following
multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Of 4,140 adults, 24% had a mood disorder diagnosed in the first year of

good (four of five lesions gave exact agreement). Results are encouraging and

A hyperelastic fiber-reinforced material model was used to describe the passive
behavior of the myocardium during diastole. The active behavior of the heart
resulting from myofiber contractions was added to the passive tissue during
systole. The active and passive properties govern the LV constitutive equation.
These mechanical properties were altered using optimal Latin hypercube design of 
experiments to obtain training FE models with varied active properties (volume
and pressure predictions) and varied passive properties (stress predictions). For
prediction of LV pressures, we used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) and
Cubist, and XGBoost was used for predictions of LV pressures, volumes as well as 
LV stresses. The LV pressure and volume results obtained from ML were similar to 
FE computations. The ML results could capture the shape of LV pressure as well as
LV pressure-volume loops. The results predicted by Cubist were smoother than
those from XGBoost. The mean absolute errors were as follows: XGBoost volume:
1.734 ± 0.584 ml, XGBoost pressure: 1.544 ± 0.298 mmHg, Cubist volume: 1.495 ±

IL-17A/F-dependent immunity at mucosal surfaces, whereas those of connective

We report a three-generation family with an autosomal dominant (AD) combination
of CMC and a previously undescribed form of CTD that clinically overlaps with
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The patients are heterozygous for a private
splice-site variant of MAPK8, the gene encoding c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1),
a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. This variant is loss-of-expression and
loss-of-function in the patients' fibroblasts, which display AD JNK1 deficiency
by haploinsufficiency. These cells have impaired, but not abolished, responses to
IL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, the development of the patients' TH17 cells was
impaired ex vivo and in vitro, probably due to the involvement of JNK1 in the
TGF-β-responsive pathway and further accounting for the patients' CMC.
Consistently, the patients' fibroblasts displayed impaired JNK1- and
c-Jun/ATF-2-dependent induction of key extracellular matrix (ECM) components and 
regulators, but not of EDS-causing gene products, in response to TGF-β.
Furthermore, they displayed a transcriptional pattern in response to TGF-β
different from that of fibroblasts from patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome caused
by mutations of TGFBR2 or SMAD3, further accounting for the patients' complex and
unusual CTD phenotype. This experiment of nature indicates that the integrity of 
the human JNK1-dependent MAPK signaling pathway is essential for IL-17A- and

heart failure (HF). Sinoatrial node (SAN) adenosine A1 receptors (ADO A1Rs) are
upregulated in HF, and adenosine is known to exert negative chronotropic effects 
on the SAN. Here, we investigated the role of A1R signaling at physiologically
relevant ADO concentrations on HF SAN pacemaker cells.
MAIN METHODS: Dogs with tachypacing-induced chronic HF and normal controls (CTL) 
were studied. SAN tissue was collected for A1R and GIRK mRNA quantification. SAN 
cells were isolated for perforated patch clamp recordings and firing rate (bpm), 
slope of slow diastolic depolarization (SDD), and maximum diastolic potential
(MDP) were measured. Action potentials (APs) and currents were recorded before
and after addition of 1 and 10 μM ADO. To assess contributions of A1R and G
protein-coupled Inward Rectifier Potassium Current (GIRK) to ADO effects, APs
were measured after the addition of DPCPX (selective A1R antagonist) or TPQ
(selective GIRK blocker).
KEY FINDINGS: A1R and GIRK mRNA expression were significantly increased in HF. In
addition, ADO induced greater rate slowing and membrane hyperpolarization in HF
vs CTL (p < 0.05). DPCPX prevented ADO-induced rate slowing in CTL and HF cells. 
The ADO-induced inward rectifying current, IKado, was observed significantly more
frequently in HF than in CTL. TPQ prevented ADO-induced rate slowing in HF.
SIGNIFICANCE: An increase in A1R and GIRK expression enhances IKAdo, causing
hyperpolarization, and subsequent negative chronotropic effects in canine chronic
HF at relevant [ADO]. GIRK blockade may be a useful strategy to mitigate
bradycardia in HF.

organizing brain processes because it provides a recurrent temporal frame for
information coding. However, the low-frequency cortical phase exhibits great
flexibility in response to external influences. Given that brain rhythms have
been found to track respiratory inputs, we hypothesized that slow breathing,
commonly associated with mental regulation, could reorganize the relationship
between these two rhythmic systems through the adjustment of the cortical phase
to such a slow train of inputs. Based on simultaneous magnetoencephalography and 
respiratory measurements, we report that while participants performed paced
breathing, slow relative to normal breathing modulated cortical phase activity in
the alpha range across widespread brain areas. Such modulation effects were
specifically locked to the middle of the inspiration stage and exhibited a
well-structured pattern. At the single-subject level, the phase angles underlying
the effects became more likely to be diametrically opposed across breaths,
indicating unique and consistent phase adjustment to slow inspiratory inputs.
Neither cardiac fluctuations nor breathing-unrelated task effects could account

transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) despite the increase in
periprocedural complications. The left ventricle (LV) remodelling process that
follows TAVR is considered to play an important role. We aim to investigate
whether gender difference affects the process of LV remodelling after TAVR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) after TAVR
were enrolled. Echocardiography was performed at baseline before the TAVR
procedure and repeated upon discharge, and at three, nine and 12 months
post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Women exhibited an early regression of LV mass and the LV mass index
(LVMi) decreased 12.0% from 148.3 ± 48.0 to 130.5 ± 43.7 g/m2 at just a median of
17 days after the procedure (P < .001). Almost one-half of the LVMi regression
occurred by 17 days post-TAVR and the LVMi regressed 22.0% by 12 months
post-TAVR. In contrast, the regression of LVMi in men seemed to be more gradual
and the significant regression of LVMi from baseline began to be observed since
three months later after TAVR. The LVMi reduction at nine months was 11.5% and
achieved 15.4% over one year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed
only the female sex, better LVEF and greater baseline LVMi were independently
associated with greater LVMi regression after TAVR, indicating female gender is
an independent predictor for favourable LV remodelling after TAVR.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, female patients with AS had favourable reverse
remodelling with greater and earlier LV mass regression post-TAVR compared with
the male patients.

by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and early
onset of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. FH is caused by mutations in
genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR),
apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin 
kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals
not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects 
of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are
encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic
individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease.
Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this
explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these 
subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends
not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular
disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low
HDL-cholesterol, obesity and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk 
can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by
detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins
are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these
medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels.
Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C
in FH patients.

myelokathexis, or WHIMs) is a very rare autosomal dominant immunodeficiency
disorder attributable to mutations in CXCR4. We reviewed clinical manifestations 
in 24 patients in 9 families to expand understanding of this syndrome.
RECENT FINDINGS: Warts, cellulitis and respiratory infections are common in
patients with WHIMs. Less commonly these patients have congenital heart disease, 
human papilloma virus-associated malignancies (cervical and vulvular) and
lymphomas. Hearing loss because of recurrent otitis media is another important
complication. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is
controversial; this review indicates that it is effective to prevent and treat
infections based upon long-term observations of patients enrolled in the Severe
Chronic Neutropenia International Registry. Understanding the natural history and
diversity of this syndrome are important for ongoing clinical trials of novel
agents to treat WHIMs.
SUMMARY: WHIM syndrome has diverse manifestations; some features occur
consistently in almost all patients, for example, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia
and mild hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the clinical consequences are quite
variable across patient cohorts and within families. Each complication is
important as a cause for morbidity and a source for patient and family concerns.","Dale DC, Dick E, Kelley M, Makaryan V, Connelly J, Bolyard AA.",Current opinion in hematology. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000554.

and migration assays were used to detect the functions of IL-7, BIL, and microRNA

Additionally, Western blot tested the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and

proteins. Moreover, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also was used to detect
inflammatory factor levels. IL-7 was used to construct an inflammatory injury

migration, and expressions of inflammatory factors and MMPs. Furthermore, we
found BIL negatively regulated miR-125a, and the miR-125a mimic could partly
reverse the effects of BIL on IL-17-injury. Finally, we showed that BIL inhibited
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways,

affects 5-6 million people in endemic areas of the Americas. Presently,
chemotherapy relies on two compounds that were proposed as trypanocidal drugs

parasitemia and to avoid seroconversion in infected people when used in the acute
phase; however, their use in the chronic phase (the time when the majority of

also able to reduce the infection of macrophages, led us to propose that this

cardiovascular diseases. Studies have confirmed the anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, anti-bacterial and insecticidal, anti-tumor and neuro-protective
effects of DAP. However, its anti-arthritic potential remains unexplored. The aim
of this study is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo chondroprotective
effects of DAP.
MAIN METHODS: The effect of DAP on primary rabbit chondrocytes was examined using
recombinant human IL-1β for 24 h. For the in vivo studies, rabbits were randomly 
divided into groups: a normal control group and osteoarthritis (OA) groups. The
OA groups received three different doses of DAP for 4 or 8 weeks. The
anti-arthritic effect of DAP was assessed using histopathological examinations,
qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis.
KEY FINDINGS: Both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that DAP exerts a
protective effect against IL-1β in chondrocytes. In vitro, DAP inhibits the
expression of IL-6, IL-12, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13, induced by IL-1β in rabbit
chondrocytes, and stimulates the production of IL-10. The inhibitory effect of
DAP on the MMPs is partially regulated by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT, MAPK
and NF-κB signaling pathways. The effect of DAP on OA may be attributed to the
suppression of inflammatory factor secretion, chondrocyte apoptosis observed by
the decrease in pro-apoptotic Caspase-3 and BAX, and the activation of
anti-apoptotic BCL-2.
SIGNIFICANCE: DAP has a broad range of prospects in the treatment of OA, which
provides a novel therapeutic strategy for OA.

lower reproductive tract due to differences in tissue composition and variable
effects of sex steroids on mucosal immune cell distribution and activity. In this

We
examined the significance of elevated plasma renin activity in a
translationally-relevant model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which replicates 
the progressive stages (A-D) of human HF. Female mice with DCM and elevated
plasma renin activity concentrations were treated with a direct renin inhibitor
(aliskiren) in a randomized, blinded fashion beginning at Stage B HF. By
comparison to controls, aliskiren treatment normalized pathologically elevated
plasma renin activity (p < 0.001) and neprilysin levels (p < 0.001), but did not 
significantly alter pathological changes in plasma aldosterone, angiotensin II,
atrial natriuretic peptide, or corin levels. Aliskiren improved cardiac systolic 
function (ejection fraction, p < 0.05; cardiac output, p < 0.01) and
significantly reduced the longitudinal development of edema (extracellular water,
p < 0.0001), retarding the transition from Stage B to Stage C HF. The
normalization of elevated plasma renin activity reduced the loss of body fat and 
lean mass (cachexia/sarcopenia), p < 0.001) and prolonged survival (p < 0.05). In
summary, the normalization of plasma renin activity retards the progression of
experimental HF by improving cardiac systolic function, reducing the development 
of systemic edema, cachexia/sarcopenia, and mortality. These data suggest that
targeting pathologically elevated plasma renin activity may be beneficial in
appropriately selected HF patients.","Sullivan RD, Mehta RM, Tripathi R, Gladysheva IP, Reed GL.",International journal of molecular sciences. pii: E3886. doi: 10.3390/ijms20163886.

cyber-physical systems to support diverse tasks including data processing,
decision-making, information sharing and mission execution. Due to the increasing
level of integration/collaboration between humans and automation in these tasks, 
the operational performance of closed-loop human-machine systems can be enhanced 
when the machine monitors the operator's cognitive states and adapts to them in
order to maximise the effectiveness of the Human-Machine Interfaces and
Interactions (HMI2). Technological developments have led to neurophysiological
observations becoming a reliable methodology to evaluate the human operator's
states using a variety of wearable and remote sensors. The adoption of sensor
networks can be seen as an evolution of this approach, as there are notable
advantages if these sensors collect and exchange data in real-time, while their
operation is controlled remotely and synchronised. This paper discusses recent
advances in sensor networks for aerospace cyber-physical systems, focusing on
Cognitive HMI2 (CHMI2) implementations. The key neurophysiological measurements
used in this context and their relationship with the operator's cognitive states 
are discussed. Suitable data analysis techniques based on machine learning and
statistical inference are also presented, as these techniques allow processing
both neurophysiological and operational data to obtain accurate cognitive state
estimations. Lastly, to support the development of sensor networks for CHMI2
applications, the paper addresses the performance characterisation of various
state-of-the-art sensors and the propagation of measurement uncertainties through
a machine learning-based inference engine. Results show that a proper sensor
selection and integration can support the implementation of effective
human-machine systems for various challenging aerospace applications, including

public concern because of its high prevalence rate and potential risk of
alteration of brain functions and organizations. Cue exposure therapy is designed
for reducing or maintaining craving, a core factor of relapse of addiction, and
is extensively employed in addiction treatment. In a previous study, we proposed 
a machine-learning-based method to detect craving for gaming using multimodal
physiological signals including photoplethysmogram, galvanic skin response, and
electrooculogram. Our previous study demonstrated that a craving for gaming could
be detected with a fairly high accuracy; however, as the feature vectors for the 
machine-learning-based detection of the craving of a user were selected based on 
the physiological data of the user that were recorded on the same day, the
effectiveness of the reuse of the machine learning model constructed during the
previous experiments, without any further calibration sessions, was still
questionable. This ""high test-retest reliability"" characteristic is of importance
for the practical use of the craving detection system because the system needs to
be repeatedly applied to the treatment processes as a tool to monitor the
efficacy of the treatment. We presented short video clips of three addictive
games to nine participants, during which various physiological signals were
recorded. This experiment was repeated with different video clips on three
different days. Initially, we investigated the test-retest reliability of 14
features used in a craving detection system by computing the intraclass
correlation coefficient. Then, we classified whether each participant experienced
a craving for gaming in the third experiment using various classifiers-the
support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), centroid displacement-based
kNN, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest-trained with the
physiological signals recorded during the first or second experiment.
Consequently, the craving/non-craving states in the third experiment were
classified with an accuracy that was comparable to that achieved using the data
of the same day; thus, demonstrating a high test-retest reliability and the
practicality of our craving detection method. In addition, the classification
performance was further enhanced by using both datasets of the first and second
experiments to train the classifiers, suggesting that an individually customized 
game craving detection system with high accuracy can be implemented by
accumulating datasets recorded on different days under different experimental
conditions.","Kim H, Kim L, Im CH.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland). pii: E3475. doi: 10.3390/s19163475. Journal Article.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland). 2019",PubMed,Journal Article,PMID:31395802,pubmed,31395802,create date: 2019/08/09 | first author: Kim H

    Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2020 Jan 1;201(1):6-7.

Rationale: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of early
morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation, but the immunologic
mechanisms are poorly understood. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a heterogeneous
family of immune cells regulating pathologic inflammation and beneficial tissue
repair. However, whether changes in donor-derived lung ILC populations are
associated with PGD development has never been examined.Objectives: To determine 
whether PGD in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease
transplant recipients is associated with alterations in ILC subset composition
within the allograft.Methods: We performed a single-center cohort study of lung
transplantation patients with surgical biopsies of donor tissue taken before, and
immediately after, allograft reperfusion. Donor immune cells from 18 patients
were characterized phenotypically by flow cytometry for single-cell resolution of
distinct ILC subsets. Changes in the percentage of ILC subsets with reperfusion
or PGD (grade 3 within 72 h) were assessed.Measurements and Main Results:
Allograft reperfusion resulted in significantly decreased frequencies of natural 
killer cells and a trend toward reduced ILC populations, regardless of diagnosis 
(interstitial lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Seven
patients developed PGD (38.9%), and PGD development was associated with selective
reduction of the ILC2 subset after reperfusion. Conversely, patients without PGD 
exhibited significantly higher ILC1 frequencies before reperfusion, accompanied
by elevated ILC2 frequencies after allograft reperfusion.Conclusions: The
composition of donor ILC subsets is altered after allograft reperfusion and is
associated with PGD development, suggesting that ILCs may be involved in
regulating lung injury in lung transplant recipients.","Monticelli LA, Diamond JM, Saenz SA, Tait Wojno ED, Porteous MK, Cantu E, Artis D, Christie JD.",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201906-1113OC.

prevention of cancer and then in tumor therapy. Several hypotheses have
highlighted that curcumin could decreases tumor growth and invasion by acting on 
both chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. This review focuses on the
interest of use curcumin in cancer therapy by acting on the WNT/β-catenin pathway
to repress chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. In the cancer process, one 
of the major signaling pathways involved is the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which
appears to be upregulated. Curcumin administration participates to the
downregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and thus, through this action, in
tumor growth control. Curcumin act as PPARγ agonists. The WNT/β-catenin pathway
and PPARγ act in an opposed manner. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and
circadian clock disruption are common and co-substantial pathological processes
accompanying and promoting cancers. Circadian clock disruption related to the
upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway is involved in cancers. By stimulating 
PPARγ expression, curcumin can control circadian clocks through the regulation of
many key circadian genes. The administration of curcumin in cancer treatment
would thus appear to be an interesting therapeutic strategy, which acts through
their role in regulating WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ activity levels.","Vallée A, Lecarpentier Y, Vallée JN.","Journal of experimental &amp; clinical cancer research : CR. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1320-y.

(K)-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A) is a central epigenetic regulator of
metabolic reprogramming in obesity-associated diseases, neurological disorders,

naturally present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), to target LSD1. Molecular
docking and dynamic simulation approaches revealed that oleacein could target the
binding site of the LSD1 cofactor flavin adenosine dinucleotide with high
affinity and at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, oleacein was
predicted to target the interaction of LSD1 with histone H3 and the LSD1
co-repressor (RCOR1/CoREST), likely disturbing the anchorage of LSD1 to
chromatin. AlphaScreen-based in vitro assays confirmed the ability of oleacein to
act as a direct inhibitor of recombinant LSD1, with an IC50 as low as 2.5 μmol/L.
Further, oleacein fully suppressed the expression of the transcription factor
SOX2 (SEX determining Region Y-box 2) in cancer stem-like and induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cells, which specifically occurs under the control of an LSD1-targeted
distal enhancer. Conversely, oleacein failed to modify ectopic SOX2
overexpression driven by a constitutive promoter. Overall, our findings provide
the first evidence that EVOO contains a naturally occurring phenolic inhibitor of
LSD1, and support the use of oleacein as a template to design new
secoiridoid-based LSD1 inhibitors.","Cuyàs E, Gumuzio J, Lozano-Sánchez J, Carreras D, Verdura S, Llorach-Parés L, Sanchez-Martinez M, Selga E, Pérez GJ, Scornik FS, Brugada R, Bosch-Barrera J, Segura-Carretero A, Martin ÁG, Encinar JA, Menendez JA.",Nutrients. pii: E1656. doi: 10.3390/nu11071656.

terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling

species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis revealed that
vasicinone increased the phosphorylation of IGF1R/PI3K/AKT cell survival
signaling molecules and downregulated the paraquat-induced, mitogen-activated

depended critically on the activation of IGF1R, and the silencing of IGF1R by
siRNA completely abrogated the protective effect of vasicinone in SH-SY5Y cells.

PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are a new therapeutic option that significantly
(50-60%) reduces LDL-C levels, which in clinical trials translates into an
additional reduction in risk for cardiovascular events, and has a good safety
profile. However, it is a high-cost therapy, and therefore its use in clinical
practice should take its cost-effectiveness into account. Priority should be
given to use in patients at higher cardiovascular risk and those in whom high
LDL-C levels persist despite optimal lipid-lowering therapy. This consensus
document aims to summarize the main data on the clinical use of PCSK9i and to
make recommendations for Portugal on the profile of patients who may benefit most
from this therapy.
